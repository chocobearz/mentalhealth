"I had a plan to get myself killed.
Join the army, step on ied on patrol, and hope they couldn't put me back together.
That never happened.
Here I am side-eyeing my revolver because I'm tired of being unloved.
I'm tired of taking burning showers to feel warmth.
I'm tired of sleeping with a million pillows just to feel like there's someone else.
I'm tired of all the relationships and love stories I'm blasted with irl and online.
I wish I would've just killed myself on some range day a few years back.
There's no point to living a solitary existence.
I already wiped my backup hard drives and wrote my note.
It won't matter.
The final message won't ""change da world"".
Another drop in the bucket.
I lived everyday like I was dead, time to reconcile.
I had a plan to get myself killed.",-3
I took 50 pills. This is my goodbye.I’m done. I’m ugly. My ex is happy with his new girl almost a year later.. I’m single. I’m fat. People always tell me how fat I am on here. I hope I die. Goodbye all I wasn’t meant for living. I don’t mean shit.,-3
"help me please can't do this anymore. hello there, searching for fast ways to die, was thinking about gun but too many paper work to do first, also about pills was reading that it won't work that fast.... Tried to get help but my best friend started to ignore me when i told him how i feel everyday. Joined the army but things got worse... crying most of the time saying to strangers that i am okay to army colleagues, trying to smile to everyone while i feel like dead inside",-3
"Why in the fuck am I still alive. I'm going insane I'm sick of everything I just need to die I have to there is no other way. I dont have a reason to keep existing but I have many reasons to die so why the fuck am I still alive man I'm so jealous of the people that actually kill themself I want to be like them I need to be like them. Everyone would be better without me all I do is wasting people's time and annoying them with my existence. The person I cared the most about literally told me to end it because I'm annoying her. I hate being alive it's so painful. Why does suicide have to be such a taboo in society? Just give me a lethal dose of something but no because ""it will get better"" whatever man if you aren't going to give me a painless way to end my life I have to find a painful method that will make a mess. I'm so fucking sick of having no motivation to end or to be scared about the pain or whatever. I need to get over it because once I'm over it I will have my peaceful death forever and wont be able to annoy anyone with my existence.

"I can’t believe I finally did it. I just swallowed it. Enough to kill like four people. On top of sublingual Valium, I’ve lost count of the number. Goodbye. It was almost a certainty after the surgery four years ago, that I was suicidal. But I tried to stick it out. The love I was shown slowly faded away, and then eventually returned to being treated like shit. A gay guy. Body ruined. Cambridge graduate. Got ME. Parents keen on knocking me at every opportunity, I have been treated below the standard my brother and sister receive. I will text my lawyer now. I want all my estate from my claim to go to my niece and nephew, on completion of their degrees. That’s it. I hope this fucking works. I don’t know what we can say on here, but I filled a condom with a load of this stuff that usually over 2ml will make you pass out. Fuck I have taken over 200mg Valium, loads of Anti sickness tablets, and even now a fucking handful of this extreme weight loss shit I have overdosed on before and ended up in a&e for just taking like four. I have long acting opioids, and Quetiapine too. There is no way I want to come back to this, and end up in some mental health Ward forever. Fuck. Them. All. Going to message my lawyer now, and tell him everything is going to my nephew And neice. Shit. I have so much zopiclone too. See you world, it was fun trying my hardest against all the odds, but the House always wins. I hope Scotland gets independent, Ireland reunites, and the conservatives are revealed for the fraudsters they are. It’s all about the eu making the UK reveal tax information of those hiding money in the crown dependencies, and overseas territories: the remnants of an empire, that make way for a tax haven banking sector. Nobody wants to listen, I just regret I will miss the popcorn of 01/01/21, as disaster is let loose on the folks that voted for their own destruction, to allow the rich to get richer! Every tax dodger on the planet paid off the bbc, the politicians, and murdoch naturally instructed his press to protect his billions. Now for some quetiapine. I can feel the g getting processed. Bye world. Thanks for reading.",-3
"I’ve found comfort in writing my suicide note. I plan on taking my own life two months after I turn 30.

Sick of trying to make things better for myself. This is my fate. No social skills, ugly and no friends. God hates me and wants me dead. Life isn’t worth it.

"I’m going to kill myself this Friday. I’ve had too much “what if I killed myself earlier”. I wanted to die four years ago. I still wanna die. It’s never gonna go away.

I’m coming home from work for the last time on Friday. And I’m gonna down the 300 over plus pills i have. Drink some wine and wait for my body to shut down.

I’m so sorry me. I didn’t protect you enough. I’m sorry I have to kill myself.

Goodbye shithole. You sucks.

"You think you’re fine. Finally free of depression. But you aren’t aware that depression comes in waves. You’re over this wave. But there’s always another. There’s always another wave that’s gonna hit you stronger and harder than before. And that’s why you regret not killing yourself three months prior. Save yourself from all these pain that has been inflicted on yourself.

You can never ever recover from this fucking depression.

If god exists, he wouldn’t have let you have depression. If god is as forgiving as people claims, then he wouldn’t blame you for killing yourself and freeing yourself from the pain this world brings.

Sometimes all I want, is for someone to hold me and tell me it’s ok, I don’t have to be strong, I can be a piece of shit if that’s what makes me happy. All I want is for someone to care about me to put my happiness before their expectations of who I am.

The pain never ever goes away. And this will go on and on and on until I find a way to kill myself.

"Nobody cares about me. It’s been 24 hours since I was released from the hospital and nobody has even sent me a text or email or a call to see how I’m doing. I was going to shoot myself but my mom called the police and somehow the cops found me in my car near the woods. They took my gun and ammo and locked me in the hospital for 2 days but now I’m out and no one has even checked in with me. I should have just shot myself. I would have been right all along. Now I need a new fucken plan
",-3
"I (27f) know this sounds completely insane, and maybe I am but life has gotten me down for so long now that I feel like I have no energy to do anything except starve myself to death.

I have been out of a job for a while even though I have a good education. I am still living with my parents because of COVID-19 and I can’t find a job.

I’m extremely ugly, and I feel disgusted every time I look in the mirror. Unfortunately I was just cursed with the worst possible looks a woman can have, and even though I am fit, healthy and take care of myself (good hair, makeup, clothes, teeth etc) it makes no difference to the overall bone structure of my face.

I never get hit on by men and relationships just don’t work out for me. I also don’t have any friends. I can’t afford therapy due to my situation and I know it won’t make a difference to how I look anyway.

I do take pleasure in small things- family sometimes, getting out in nature, I exercise almost daily and have a good routine.... but it isn’t enough to want to continue.

I continuously send out job applications, have gotten professional advice and good feedback about my resumé but I get rejection after rejection, even for internship or low-paid unskilled work.

I would love to try acting or even just little things like get dressed up and actually feel good about myself but I can’t unless I had a few thousand to spend on plastic surgery.

Over the past few months I’ve felt so disgusted with myself that I’ve felt like stopping eating and just starve to death because someone as ugly as I am doesn’t really have a life that’s worth living.

"I am hanging myself over a door in my house later today. I have hurt a lot of people in the brief span of my addiction-riddled life, and I cannot stand to see another dayrise alive. I don't even want to waste time feeling sorry for myself. I simply don't deserve the happiness that people get from little things; or if I pursue the YOLO ""little things"" someone comes along and beats me with, ""What about the big things?"" And all I really wanted was people. Real people, someone to have a beer with and no judgment. Love, hugs, handshakes, affection. Regular sleep, healthy medicine, decent food, and meaningful work. School, too - I wanted to succeed not take over the fucking world. Just to have a job and a woman of my own. And respect from people. I can't even live respectably. I'm a homeless guy in his own apartment. My parents won't take me back, and I dont even know if college is in my plans anymore. This block of shitty text, some failed distance relationships, porn and poetry, cigarettes and random Netflix slop at 3AM is all I have. I have no fight, no compass, no council, and people always come at me with the fabled, ""You have to want it."" - Like, like not having ""it"" means automatically that it's because you lacked the desire for it., that it's now your fault you're lonely, that you have to watch another Mechwarrior sunrise bald as a PC game, loaded with caffeinated shakes and the desire to be held by - by - well, who's there to actually rescue me? No one. The prince in distress is a shitty ass hell, because society has denounced that men need rescuing, and castigates men who do. Fuck - that - . and, yeah man. Goodbye.

"My friend is at the 5th suicide attempt ,and just gotten out of the hospital the 4th time last week. She only tells me she wants to die, after she takes about 50-70 pills of antidepressants and benzodiazepines so I could call for an ambulance. Ironically, she is heavy on medocations , the same she uses for suicide attempts. She has no family, I live in another city, she doesn't want to move with me and I have school and work in my city so I can't move with her. She is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder. I literally have no clue how to help her anymore. I talk and visit her as much as I can, give her advices of she wants some, try to keep her occupied with all sorts of activities. If anything works, it's only for awhile. After that, it gets worse. The medication is destroying her. All her hair falls, the medical checking is very bad, is dizzy and on the verge of fainting all the time, hallucinates sometimes and all sorts of other things. She has a psychiatrist and psychologist she goes to, but everytime, they only give her more medication and are making her feel bad for wanting to die. She already changed 4 psychiatrists. She wants to die because she can't stands a rejection from someone she loves. Today she texted me again, telling me she wants to overdose again. I don't know what to do anymore. Has anyone have any advice on how to help her?

"Im a student. Struggeling in life for the past decade. I have noone to talk to. My grades are going to hell. I've lost contact with all of my friends. I have nothing but debt. It's not ""im not sure if I will be able to deal with this."". It's ""i'm sure Im going to kill myself if this continue."".

"I am thinking about suicide. Honestly wondering if shooting myself in the head would do the trick. I read online that only 85% of suicide by gun result in death. Also it look scary with all the blood coming out and stuff. I am so done with life. I was born into poverty (low income) family. I hate my life. Why did my mom gave birth to me when she was 16 and still in high school? I rather be aborted then to come to this world. I was told all my life that going to college majoring in STEM is the way out of poverty. That gave me hope. Now after getting my master degree in engineering I finally realized it was all LIES. After graduation I went from one unpaid internship to another unpaid internship as my student is becoming bigger and bigger. I am really done with life. I will never be become an engineer. I will never be able to pay back my student load. I will never get out of poverty. I hate my mom for giving birth to me when she was not ready for me. To all those teen out there: abortion is the right choice for you and the kid. Don't have kids come to this world to suffer!

"I've made countless posts, all of which nobody cared enough to view.
I've tried talking to my few online friends, all of which doesn't work since we're so far apart.
I have no loving parents, they all love the image i fabricate everyday. Not the real me.
I cannot describe just how much i fucking HATE life. Whoever made me exist should deserve to be shot or tortured.
I would've been happier had I been aborted, or a miscarriage, not having to deal with the bullshit prison cell I was thrown into.
I cannot muster any courage to end my life because of the bullshit fear of death life gave me. It's surprising just how much people would gladly end their life if the fear of death went away. Because life is fucking shit.
I have nobody to rescue me, and I only live to make other people happy. Like i'm some sort of pet.
Hell is a seperation of god. A place full of torture. Weird how similar that is to life, right?
I like how suicide is just some taboo thing. People are forced to fucking suffer all day everyday because mental health isn't valid enough to bring you peace and comfort in the void, the place you were so terribly robbed from.",-3
"From my early childhood I've experienced sexual, physical and psychological abuse. With no justice no arrests and complete denial it ever even happened. I was cut out of both sides of my family for either racial reasons or went to the police for what I was going through. Both sides of my family called me a half child, a half human, a half demon or an abomination. This continued not from my family during my childhood but continued to my adult life from ""friends"" to strangers etc. My entire reason for living, my drive to succeed was my mom who died in 2008 a week after my 16th birthday. Her final message was to take care of my younger sister. I became the punching bag and protected her from all abuse. I had received a new goal, help my younger sister the only thing my mother left me. Recently she basically said fuck you she wants nothing to do with me and cutting me out of her life. I have no job, car, a lot of debt including student loans medical bills, medical health disorders and no support system. I see no point in living anymore. * I have been seeing a psychiatrist for years been on medication and received trauma therapy for years with no avail. Please no religious comments. I have no purpose and want to die.

"I think I was meant to die. I don’t really believe much of us having free will, any control over our lives anymore. I could work really hard, do all the right things for years and yet, I’m still stuck. Still denied what I want. Hard work doesn’t get you anything. I see people around me getting everything I worked for out of luck, out of thin air it would seem.

I think life is going to get better every couple of years, I set milestones, and then nothing happens. I’m still stuck. No job, no way to move out, no one who will put me first. I’m pretty unlovable. I try and I fail for no reason. On paper I look fucking great, I’ve learnt to be self confident now because why the fuck not, but I’m the end there is just something fundamentally wrong with me. Don’t ask me what it is.

I’m not really sure how to start saying goodbye. I used to cry and get rowdy and upset when I thought about suicide, now I think about it every day without little care. I’m fine writing about it. I feel nothing. I’ll be sitting in class and thinking about it, eating my lunch and thinking about it. It’s my fate, I guess.

Don’t know when I’ll do it. Not sure how. It’s been already decided for me. I just know it will be soon.

"Anyone know of a quick way to kill myself? I've heard about heart attacks and giving yourself one, but I don't think I'm strong enough to do that. I've been thinking about trying to hire someone to do it for me, but I'm sure that'd be rather difficult to find nowadays. Anyway, let me know if you come up with anything. I want something relatively bloodless but sure-fire way to die regardless. Thank you.

"I made the decision to stay up all night, drunk loads of coffee, now I am just angry at the place i'm in my life. I can't stomach my community I could never, I haven't got a normal one, I always struggle with eating disorders and kept it too myself, I tried to talk to the doctor but it wasn't a normal eating disorder. It all made me withdrawn and times just get too overwhelming, i'm so angry at my self, I hate the things in my life. I hate the lack of control I have, I hate that it feels like I have no autonomy because I get crippled, avoiding with how people judge me. I had plans on Saturday, first time in a very long time and they got cancelled, i'm struggling to stomach the loneliness and having to hide because the people I am surrounded with have no emotional intelligence I could never open up to them I tired before and they just used it to stab me in the back and make me fall deeper into a hole of being withdrawn and self-hatred, i'm fucking useless. Its frustrating being a man because its too hard to deal with my temper if I ever open up to anyone anyway, my family just tears me down, its pointless I'm going to do it

"Hi.

My name is SixtyOneDays. It's not my real name of course. It's my reddit username, and it's based on how many days I have left before I attempt to kill myself.

Attempt, because it will be my first time doing it. And I don't know if I have the guts to do it anyway.

I made this decision last year. A lot of things happened, and I think my mind and body had had enough. It's funny what loneliness do to you. Personally I knew what I needed. I needed support. I need someone to love me. As nauseating as it sounds. But humans really do need to live in a community. And I was alone for a long, long time. 19 years to be exact. And today that 19 years of loneliness is killing my will to live. Now I'm at my breaking point, and I know that death will give me the peace that I needed.

But death is not coming easy to me it seems.

Life is cruel. At the time when my depression was reaching its breaking point, Life gave me what I needed. At least it showed me what I needed. Then Life took it away from me, and I couldn't do anything to get it back.

Then I thought, okay, then let me go. Let me kill myself. You couldn't give me what I need in life. Then let me die. I need it. But no.

I had sorted things out nicely for my exit. I had written my will so my mother could have access to my money, I had settled most of my debts except mortgage which would take me so many years. I knew how to kill myself. But Life wouldn't let me go the easy way.

I just settled my finances a week ago. And right after that, my mom fell sick. High blood pressure. Symptoms of stroke. My sisters brought her to three doctors. They all said the same thing.

My mom is dependent on me. Before this she was fine and healthy, so I thought even if I left, she could survive. But now, I'm not sure.

And I don't know why Life did that to me.

I don't know what Life wants me to do.

Stay behind and take care of my mom, at least until she pass away? I could. But I would suffer every night. I have been cutting myself since last year. Most nights I cry myself to sleep. I don't have anyone to talk to. Anyone with depression would know how painful it is.

And I wonder why Life wants me to suffer in silent. Why Life wants me to hurt and take care of others so they wouldn't hurt. I don't know why.

I don't understand.

I need it. I need to die.

And I read about this right to die organisation, who provides euthanasia for those who are physically suffering. But not for someone like me.

I read in Reddit threads how a lot of people feel people like me who are mentally suffering should not have access to euthanasia because they are physically well.

And I always think, how lucky you are to feel that way.

You're lucky if you've never had this prolonged urge to die. I've been there before and I am still here. It's not something I would wish on anyone.

But why can't I choose to die in peace. At least with certified physicians, I would be able to go away peacefully. I wouldn't have to worry about things going wrong if I did it myself.

Life is not fair. I know.

I don't know why I'm writing this.

I guess I just want people to know how I feel inside.

"Being dead seems cozy, warm and nice to me. No feelings and no coldness, no hotness, no sad. Just a comforting nothingness, forever. It seems so cozy and nice, just like sleeping is cozy and nice. Just a nice warm sleep forever

"I am a privileged person and I pretty much have everything that I would need or want. No one thinks that I have a reason to be depressed because I don’t have the struggles that other people have. But even if I have everything, I can’t help but feel so sad and suicidal because my future looks so bleak.

It’s hard for me to be motivated to do anything and I’ve been putting off so many things that should have been done a long time ago. I’ve started ignoring a lot of my friends and burning relationships that actually matter to me. I am wasting most of my days on the internet or Netflix and ignoring all of my responsibilities.

I just don’t feel like going on and I don’t see why I have to keep living. My friend died over a year ago and it’s made my depression so much worse and honestly I don’t want to be alive without her. I know that I’ll have happy moments in life too, but I get so many periods where I am anxious and depressed that I would give up that happiness if it meant I’d never feel anxious/depressed again.

I just don’t see how I can truly be happy in the future and I feel nauseous and anxious just thinking about my life. I don’t have intent right now, but I feel stuck because I also don’t want to live.

"I have made up my mind to commit suicide. I already feel like a ghost around my family. In all my interactions with my family members, I already feel like I'm not there anymore. All I can think about is how badly I'm going to devastate them in a few years, how I'm going to completely, irreversibly change their lives. I already feel like I'm a memory, a face they'll only be able to see in pictures, someone they'll grow older than while I stay the same age forever. It's a very disconnected feeling.
