0,happy,"Hey all,

After a lot of humming and harring, I decided to cover an interesting, mental health based topic. A deep delve into the wonderful double edged sword that is bipolar. Hopefully this helps inspire people suffering with their Mental Health.

Here is a link to my article. My blog generates 0 income, it is not a business and is purely to express my creative side. I hope post this here, is ok.",0
1,happy,"Day 8 of taking new antidepressants and day 7 clean from self harm. I�m really really trying, one week is huge for me!",1
2,happy,- I have no one else to celebrate with so i came here!! I'm seeing a psychiatrist again after 3 years. I was a minor when i saw the first one so i didnt really take it or the meds seriously and stopped after a month. But my mental health has progressively,1
3,happy,I used to self harm every day. My arms might be scared but they haven't seen a blade for 2 years. I threw all blades away into the trash.,1
4,happy,"So freaking good. I just wanted to come here and say that. I feel like I�ve been in and out of therapy for so long and mostly it just felt meh and like it was really just a place for me to vent. This therapist gets deep, and is getting me to do that work and just rocks. I actually feel like I�m accomplishing shit in there and on my way to healing. I think part of it was my readiness to be open and really take a look at myself internally but she is just totally the right therapist for me. 

Anyway if you feel like you haven�t gotten that much out of therapy don�t give up. First you do have to be willing to confront things and do hard messy work but also not every therapist is the right therapist for you so don�t be afraid to try a new one.",1
5,happy,"T/W- mention of self harm and eating disorders

I�ve been staying with a friend for a while, and my mental health has been doing so well. We�ve been getting so much done, waking up early to exercise and getting all of our work finished before lunch time.
I�ve had three meals every day for over a week now, and for me that�s truly amazing as I�ve struggled with eating disorders for nearly five years. Normally, getting (and keeping) any more than one meal down every 2-3 days is so difficult for me to manage. But three meals a day!! I cant even remember when I last ate this well! It�s been so tricky to build up enough mental strength to eat well, and I�m honestly not sure how long it will last, but for now I�m really proud of myself. 

I�ve been clean from cutting for about two weeks, I�ve only had five panic attacks in the last eight days (another huge accomplishment!), I�ve been showering and cleaning and taking care of myself and it feels so amazing. My clothing is all clean and my bedsheets are fresh, the fridge is well stocked and I even know a few new recipes! 

I�m not the kind of person who can change their lives around overnight, and I�ll probably relapse so many times before truly getting my shit together (if i ever do!), but these last few weeks have been a huge step forward for me and right this moment I�m proud of myself. Looking back a few years and I was so horribly depressed, dangerously underweight and covered in self harm burns, cuts and bruises from shoulders to thighs.

I�ve come so far, and I�m so proud of my progress, and for the first time I don�t feel guilty about it.",1
6,happy,"I was feeling exhausted and burnt up all of June. I think the quarantine blues finally got to me. I was so tired I didn�t even want to brush my teeth some days. Was in a angry mood for a week, giving myself headaches from overthinking.

But today. Oh, today was a good day. I made a list of what I need/wanted to do during the summer. From exercising to studying, I tried to plan what I could do now to help future me. And to start it off, I cleaned my bedroom and washroom!! And I enjoyed it!! Played some YouTube videos while I dusted and vacuum. Threw out some unneeded items, put my clothes away. I was in a cleaning mood. Next is to redecorate a bit and I�m excited for it!

I was so worried that I would be exhausted all summer. Doing nothing but sleeping and regretting it everyday. But I did it. I did something that didn�t make me feel so drained afterwards. I just hope my exhausted brain can finally get that energy back :)",1
7,happy,"It�s been a rough few years for me, just recently started therapy again and it�s been awesome. I feel so much better about everything!",1
8,happy,"I hope this post isn't triggering for others going through the same. But i am glad the urge has gone for now.

I never admitted this to anyone but my best friend. I have self harmed since i was about 9 years old. 

I always cut myself in places it could be passed off as an accident. I never wanted people to know i was doing it but i just felt the urge to feel something physical other than emotional. 

The last time i self harmed was 2 years ago and it was so deep it still hasnt fully healed to this day. I feel ashamed of them and hate when people ask me about how i got my scars or when they look at them. It gets harder each time to explain how i got the wounds but sometimes i felt it was the only way to feel something. 

I have had no urges to do it recently and hope it stays that way.",1
9,happy,I've been struggling with my mental health since I was in sixth grade and went to the hospital for anxiety that I thought was my lungs failing (that's a fun story to tell at parties) and I just finished tenth. This has been long awaited and I'm so excited! The appointment is on the 23rd and I'm already pumped. I can't wait to start getting better so that I can really commit to my passions and goals!,1
10,happy,"50 days ago was the last time I cut myself, I'm half of the way to 100! I doubted I'd even make it a month To anyone who's lost hope, I believe in you!",1
11,happy,"I�ve been doing it for 3 years and I am now 1 month completely clean from it, I�m proud of myself don�t get me wrong but there is always an urge to do it. The urge this month has been so much bigger than usual probably because I�ve stopped lol but I�m proud that I�ve resisted and I�m so hopeful that this lasts forever I really believe I�m gonna succeed this time :)",1
12,happy,"After years of struggling, I finally worked up the courage to see a therapist. I didn�t do this alone though. My friend will never see this post, but he has no clue that him openly talking about his therapy experience was one of the driving factors behind motivating me to schedule my first appointment ever. 

It�s been way too long since I started telling myself I wouldn�t be stuck in this rut forever. I�m finally taking that first step and doing what I always said I would do. I�m not lying to myself or my friends anymore. I�m actually going to therapy!",1
13,happy,"It�s been exactly one year now since I�ve been clean of any self harm, I never thought I�d make it one day, one week; let alone one year!! 
Whoever is reading this; know that you can do it!! It�ll be hard and take time, but you can bloody do it ????",1
14,happy,"So recently, I started to have another dip in my mental health and I freaked.

I reached out to a support group I'm in and I was contacted by a therapist who's helping me for free. I just wanted to share this as it truly touched me as I didn't think I was going to get help. I'm also using a CBD and THC tincture daily to help with my depression and anxiety, and so far it's working well!

I'm finally getting better!",1
15,happy,"My own parents ignore my unhappiness and this quarantine made things difficult for me but I think I have found things to hang on to. The urge to relapse is strong but I will not give up I swear.

I love you guys...?? I'm so grateful that Reddit exists honestly. Take care of yourself, take it easy today. If someone wants advice, or want to talk about their problems or just how's life for you, please feel free to send me a message. <3 Have a good day/night!

16,happy,"Eating properly, 1 month free of self harm, stable mental health, and finally beginning to accept myself. I am so happy and I love life for once. Haven't thought of suicide for weeks. Life can be good sometimes. :)",1
17,happy,"I don�t intend this as some sort of brag post, and I apologize if it comes off that way. It�s more that I want to share my real-life example of how that �It gets better� slogan can sometime be true. I guess I also just want to put it into actual words. Part of me still can�t believe it, but I�m happy.

My brother asked me the other day if I was doing alright, as I seemed a little short tempered to him. This came as a surprise to me, as I�ve been feeling pretty good. No, I replied, I�m doing pretty well. The thought stuck with me though, and the more I thought about it the more I realized it was true. I�m happy right now. Really, genuinely happy. I feel, for the first time since I graduated High School in 2007, if not �in control� of my life (which I�ve come to believe is a complete fiction, NO ONE is �in control� of their life), then at least like it isn�t spinning out wildly like some Hellish, broken carnival ride.

I�m Bipolar 2, with GAD and ADHD for flavor. Of course, I didn�t always know this. My parents thought a lot of my emotional problems were diet related growing up (I�ve got some hypoglycemia, history of Type 2 Diabetes in the family�). They did take me to a therapist in 7th grade who I stonewalled for all six sessions. It wasn�t until I moved to the other side of the country for college that my issues became horribly, crystalline clear.

I couldn�t function. At all. I lived in the dorm but avoided my roommates or any other variety of socialization. I stopped eating. I did my best to go to classes but eventually I couldn�t handle that either. I stopped attending. I stopped answering my parent�s phone calls. I didn�t get out of bed. Those first two semesters, I flunked nearly everything. By the end of the year, I tried to kill myself.

The next solid decade was a rinse-and-repeat of depression, doctors, medications, therapy, lies, community college, awful part-time jobs, and a deeply felt, vicious self-loathing. I hated myself. I hated what an absolute fucking failure I was, what an idiot, what a screw-up. I thought I was a burden to the people around me. I wished I was dead.

It took me all 10+ of those years to learn how to manage my anxiety. I learned through trial and error which CBT techniques really worked for me and employed them regularly. I had to learn how to ask for help and, perhaps even more importantly, that asking for help wasn�t shameful, that I was doing the right thing for everyone by reaching out to the people who still loved me. I figured out how to spot the early symptoms of a depressive episode, and that alerting my support network and making sure I stuck to a dedicated routine would help me stave off the worst of it. I started exercising twice a week.

Over time --with innumerable stumbles, set-backs, and repetition-- I began to feel like I could manage my symptoms. Eventually, I went back to school. Last year, after a decade-long battle, I graduated with an BS from a small but respectable university. I almost immediately lucked into a good job in my desired field.

I started to feel confident again, and at 29 I started dating. I�d only done so a little before, always feeling like I was too �crazy� for a real relationship, like I couldn�t put that fucked-up baggage on somebody else, that no one would want a crazy girl anyway. But when I started dating, something unimaginably wonderful happened. I fell in love for the first time. I even told him about the Bipolar and the Anxiety, and while it was pretty rocky immediately after (man, did he ask some WTF questions, but that�s a story for another time), we sorted it out and he was an open and understanding listener. We�ve been together over a year and a half now. We have a beautiful, sweet dog named Finn.

So when my brother asked me if I was doing okay, it really hit me that, yes, I was. Things definitely aren�t perfect (my boyfriend's family, oh man!), but I finally feel like I�m doing okay. Like the future could be net positive, if not always easy.

If you�re in the dark right now and you know with absolute certainty that you can�t get out, I just want to say that you�re not Nostradamus and no one can know the future. It might take longer --much, much longer-- than you�d like, but you can climb out of the dark place. If that sounds like pie-in-the-sky, then, trust me, I�m as surprised as you are to find out it�s not.

Stay safe, and be well.",1
18,happy,"This just happened a few minutes ago.

I was on my phone today, just checking steam when i got a notification from someone that wanted to friend me. I quickly checked my profile and i saw a new badge. Apparently, the same person that added me, gave me that badge for a review i made on TF2. 

We talked about video games, weird things and other stuff like that. He just returned to his computer and asked if i still played TF2. I said yes. He asked me if i wanted some items. I was really happy, but didn't know how to respond, because i thought what he was going to give me was very expensive and didn't want him to lose money, but i eventually said yes. 

He then asked if i had Gmod. I don't have that game either. He said he could gift it to me. I was like ""are you crazy?"". I asked if i could recompensate him for it and he said he didn't want anything in return. I was shocked because things like this never happened to me before. 

He asked if i wanted Gmod or money. I had money, but not enough for Gmod and i didn't have enough money, so i asked for Gmod.

I thought it was just a joke at first, but then a new e-mail went to me. It said that person send me the game. I was like ""WHAT?!"" I never thought this would happen. 

And so begins our friendship...

If that friend is reading this, then remember that i love you.",1
19,happy,"So for context, my grandma runs a drum circle for deaf people. They haven't been able to get together due to my grandparents being in very strict quarantine, as they are both old and cancer survivors. Not being able to get together with her group has made my grandma pretty sad. 

I thought that sending her a bongo cat meme would make her a bit happier, and it did! But, now she sends me all her favorite bongo cat memes. She even asked my brother, who is staying with them, if he could help her make some, and she now posts videos of her cats photo shopped to play bongos on her Facebook.

This really wouldn't be much of a problem, but not only does she send me memes, she also asks my dad to show me the videos she posts on Facebook, which is surprisingly often. Over the last week or so, she has learned how to Photoshop herself, and no longer needs my brother help. Everyone is really happy that shes gotten out of this depression. 

TL:DR my grandma is in love with bongo cat",1
20,happy,"BACKGROUND: The reason why this is so special to me is that she isn't really my real niece. She's my cousin's daughter and in my family, it's me, her and another cousin that are basically sisters to each other but their brothers won't have children and I don't have siblings so we'll never get to be real aunts. So to combat this we decided that we'll just be aunts to our children instead.

So my niece is turning three this August and it made me think to the first time she spoke to me. It wasn't much special to the others but I wanted to be the cool aunt she looks up to and always wants to hang out with when we're around each other. I was sitting in their front room and she was playing with her dad when she shouted out that she wanted to play hide and seek. So her dad went to hide while I sat there watching her instantly lose interest which was oddly funny. Then she approached me and said, ""(my name) come help me!"". You best believe I shot out of my seat to help her find her dad. When she did I sat back down but she came over again while her dad was counting and said again ""(my name) let's go hide!"" and by god, I almost cried.

Might not seem that special but man it got me in the feels.",1
21,happy,"


My grandpa was a Vietnam escapee, one day he was fed up with living in Vietnam. he wanted a better life for his children. So, he boarded a fishing rowboat with two loaves of bread and three oranges he would keep riding the boat until he was free of Vietnam. The ride was longer than he anticipated and soon he ran out of food. One day, just as he was about to give up a larger steamship saw his frail body atop his old and battered boat. They lowered a rope and with all his strength he climbed that rope. He thought of a better life, he thought of his family, he gathered up all the strength in his drained figure and he made it up onto the boat. The kind human beings on that fishing boat is the reason I am here in America writing this post. My grandpa is the bravest person II know and i need the world to remember that there are good people on this planet; Earth.",1
22,happy,"A few years ago, my ex introduced me to a girl and her mom that would become a HUGE part of my life. They spared no expense to ensure they lived in a safe area however as a family of two they do not have a lot of money. The mom is a detective and the daughter is a chef that's unable to work in her industry due to a chronic ailment.

They have become somewhat of a surrogate family to me. Especially back then, my relationship with the people in my own house was not remotely good. It's been on the mends recently though. But they'd always make sure I was okay and that I was fed. They'd start watching a series with me and even though I could only visit every other day they would wait for me to be there before we carried on.

They would listen to me and really made me feel heard when I was feeling anxious and depressed and gave me the advice I needed to start fixing my life.

They still struggle with money and although I pay rent where I live and for food and medicines. I ALWAYS made sure whenever I went to their house that I'd take something luxury for them like cheese, chocolates, high grade meats and sneak it into their fridge. I always offer assistance in taking the daughter to her appointments and helping the mom with grocery shopping and taking their cats to the vet and to get their vaccinations.

Today marks 5 years since I met them, and mom left me a note on their kitchen counter. It covers a lot of personals but in it she has stipulated that she is going to be putting me in her will as she feels that I have become another daughter to her and she wants me to know that I am definitely a part of their family!

I've also been saving what little money I can in a bank account to buy flights to Australia so her daughter can see her father for the first time in several years. I'm almost there and hopefully will be able to make it happen for her in the future",1
23,happy,"me (19M) and my boyfriend (20M) we're enjoying the sun at a lake with lots of ducks, swans, geese etc. we went for a paddle in the lake, but I decided to go for a swim, so I got out and wrapped a towel around me. 
Enter awesome kid (AK). he was about 8 years old, and had just seen me get out of the lake. the encounter went as follows:

AK: can you go swimming in the lake?
Me: yeah, the water is nice.
AK: is it against the rules?
me: no, nobody will come tell you off for swimming.

This kids face absolutely lights up when he realises that no park ranger is gonna be mad if he has a swim. so he runs off, takes off his shirt and shoes and runs into the lake at full speed.
My BF and I assumed that he had asked his parents if it was ok for him to go for a swim, regardless he was having the absolute time of his life whilst having a chat to me and BF.

Enter mum. 
mum, half laughing, half mad: OMG AK WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE LAKE
AK: those people said it was ok!
mum: THEYRE NOT YOUR PARENTS AK! come out now!

meanwhile AK is completely unbothered, having the time of his life and enjoying a swim. we're just trying to hide from the mum bc we lowkey feel responsible for her son yeeting himself into the lake, but at least we were keeping an eye on him.

AK runs out, takes off his socks (for some reason he went into the lake in socks?) and RUNS BACK IN. 
Meanwhile, his parents are absolutely cracking up at the chaotic energy radiating off this boy. He eventually gets out the lake with his parents and waves at us from their car.",1
24,happy,"A little over 2.5 years ago I adopted our first dog, Kiedis, (think Anthony Kiedis of RHCP) a 2 year old Siberian Husky into my family of a 16, 4 and 6 year old boys. This was the youngest boys (4 and 6) first real experience with dogs. As such, they were a bit rough with Kiedis at first. They figured this horse-sized dog was a playmate. It was constant correction from me and frustration on the poor Kiedis. Eventually the boys learned to rough and tumble with one another and be gentle with the dog. Fast forward a few months later and we adopted another dog to help ease our naturally anxious Husky while we were not at home during the day. We invited Sirius into our lives, a 10 year old Cairn Terrier. Well, my youngest decides to pull an �Elmira� and was constantly trying to hug and pick up and squeeze our old boy, Sirius. It was back to constant correction. Until one day....
I would usually say �Don�t do that! He/they doesn�t/do not like it! He�s/They�re getting mad and may bite� My son would retort, �How do you know?� I would say, �Because dogs don�t like that�. It wasn�t working or clicking in his little mind. 
So one day after the 1,742,346th time of telling him to stop with the dogs and the same argument, �How do you know?�, I responded, �He told me�. This caught his attention. He said, �What did he say?� I then said something to the effect of �Get off me. You�re annoying!�. This brought instant amazement to my 4.5 year old and 6.5 year old that I could understand �doggie speak�. This evolved and I became a doggie translator. 
The dogs now have their own voices. My 19 year old got on board and also does the voices. Because Sirius is a Cairn Terrier, he naturally has a Scottish accent. Mind you, my imitation of a Scottish accent is terrible. And now whenever I use the �Sirius voice�, he comes a runnin because he has associated it with himself. Kiedis has a derpy man voice. I�m a woman so my low voice is atrocious. 
Even now that my boys are 6 and 8, they will attest that I can speak dog and translate with accuracy. 

Side note: Sirius has been known to swear, much to the amusement of the boys, which is his right as a 84 year old man in human years to his 12.5 doggie years. 
He also has a tragic back story that my 19 year old and I developed in jest. We adopted Sirius at 10 years old and don�t know much of his history. So we made it up lmao. 

My boys just got a new puppy at their Dad�s house and I fear our long ruse of being doggie translators will be up soon. I know their Dad will not use the same flair for imagination as we do in our house. Ah well, it was good while it lasted! And who knows, the boys might play along since it�s so fun. This has taken a life of its own now. My 19 year old and I do the voices even when the boys are with their Dad.",1
25,happy,"I've been looking at my mementos from teaching and thought of this.

For a number of years, I taught in central Japan as an English teacher. It was a lot of fun and some of the best years of my life. One particular class I had was a bunch (7-8 I believe) of boisterous 5-6 year-old girls. My height shocked them initially (I'm about 6'3"") but the defining moment was during a class. There was a fly buzzing around the room and like most kids, they were easily distracted, so my hand shot out and I managed to snatch it out of the air (before releasing it outside). This act cemented me as the most fearsome woman they had ever met but also green-lit that they could be a bit rougher with me. They're a great class, if a little crazy at times.

Months later, I ended up getting an injection in my shoulder. Not a big deal but the attending nurse wasn't exactly careful so my shoulder was pretty tender. While kneeling during one of our many games, one of the girls excitedly shakes my arm. The resulting wince and slight gasp brought the game to a screeching halt. Within a second, they've gathered around. One student lifts my sleeve and realizes (with a bit of pantomiming) that I had gotten a shot. Youngest & Sweetest student dashes to the window, banging on it to get the attention of her mother, saying that she has to come in and kiss my shoulder because I was hurt. The #1 troublemaker comes over to pat my hand comfortingly all while looking me in the eye. ""Sensei, it's okay to cry. Last time I went to the hospital, I got a shot too and it was very scary. We won't tell anyone so don't feel bad about it.""

26,happy,"So in middle school there was this one kid who was always silent, but he was nice to everyone. Nobody was mean to him, but he was just alone all the time, so i just decided to talk to him. He was shy, and never looked at you when you talked, but the more we became friends the more i saw the kind, and happy person he was. People were shocked cause he was talking so much, and he made a few friends along the way. No matter how small or large someone is, maybe they just need a conversation to wake them up.",1

One night I woke my mom up and she walked into my bedroom that I shared with my brother and she saw GGM. GGM turned to my mom and said ""You know if you feed her she'll stop crying""

My mom turned her head for just a moment and she was gone.

My family told me so much about her, it feels like I met her. I like to believe that GGM passed at the right time to be my guardian angel.

28,happy,"So, because of the whole thing with George Floyd, Rayshard Brooks (Hope I spelled his name right :,) ), and all the others, I decided to share a little story my mom told me about to remind people that not all cops are bad. As a disclaimer, I'm not into the whole ""Blue lives matter"" thing, I definitely believe all the cops that have done wrong to others should be punished for their actions, not just by being fired. However, we should shed some light on all the good cops out there.

So, a couple days ago, my mom was going for a walk with my 3 year old sister. She was holding one of those Paw Patrol plushies. It's one of her favorite shows, alongside Peppa Pig and Mickey Mouse. Anyway, they were passing by a police station with a rookie police officer sitting on the front. He just so happened to notice my sister's Paw Patrol plushie and pointed it out. He then asked if any of them have been in a police car before. My mom said she has been in one, but my sister hasn't. Next thing they knew, the officer was letting my sister get inside the car. Of course, she couldn't drive it, but she was allowed to use the sirens and the lights. I couldn't be there, since I was at my grandparents' at the time, but I could just imagine the look of pure joy on her face to be a Paw Patrol officer, even for a moment.",1

30,happy,"I believe this belongs here. This is a story from 2017 and is about the best birthday that I've ever had. 

Backstory: My birthday is two days before Christmas. My parents also divorced when I was 1 year old. When I was little I was allowed to have birthday parties with whomever I wanted. It was usually family with a few exceptions when I had friends come over for the day. When I got older, fewer and fewer family members would want to celebrate my birthday on the day of and opted to just give me gifts on Christmas with the exception of my mom, step-dad, and my youngest sister (my mom's daughter - I have other siblings but they're on my dad's side). Because of this, I am hugely opposed to people having to share special days either with each other (unless they want to of course) or with holidays. I am of the opinion that everyone should have their own special day. So every year around November I would start seeing who would want to do something for my birthday. My mom, step-dad, and sister were always among those who would and then I would bring whatever friends were willing to join me. 

In this story, ""my parents"" will refer to my mom and step-dad. 

Story: I met my current boyfriend at the end of October of 2017. He and I quickly became inseparable and he was and is my best friend. In November, my mom let me know that her, my step-dad, and sister were going to be going on vacation in December and wouldn't be back until Christmas Day and wanted me to watch their dogs. I was disappointed that she was going away but she said that it was the only time that they could get off because of payroll (she's an accountant). I agreed to watch the dogs and told my boyfriend what was going on and asked if he would want to hang out with me for my birthday. He said yes and we started thinking of fun things to do to distract me from my parents being gone. 

Come Thanksgiving, I got to meet his family for the first time. We hit it off extremely well. He had said that his grandma was rough around the edges but she and I got along great and their family was the most welcoming I had ever met. Apparently his family liked me back and they asked the next day if I'd be joining them for Christmas too. I said that I would do my absolute best to make sure that could happen. 

So the day came when my parents went on their vacation and I started puppy-sitting. My boyfriend came over and helped me as one of the pups decided that all of my yarn and stuffed animals were hers and tried to eat them. 

The day of my birthday came around and I slept in and then started debating what I would be doing that day as I'd had ideas but hadn't settled on what to do especially since I still had the pups to take care of. My boyfriend then asked if I wouldn't mind going to see his parents later that afternoon. We headed over there and I was greeted with the entire group from Thanksgiving - his parents, brother, brother's girlfriend, sister, nephew, and a little bit later the grandma. When grandma came in she was carrying a huge cake that said Happy Birthday on it. His dad made a wonderful meal and they all got me presents and sang happy birthday to me. I had only met these people one time before and they went out of their way to put together a birthday party for me. It meant the world to me and ever since I have gone out of my way to do anything and everything I can to help them out so they feel as loved as they made me feel that day.",1
31,happy,"just to get this out of the way I'm on a computer, english is my native language, my spelling and grammar are absolute shit.

Through basically all of the seventh grade, I sat in the same spot next to the pillar on the right under the overhang in front of the school library. After I finished eating I would go inside the library and help out. (mostly checking in and out books) I would do this just about every single day of the school year. Eighth grade rolls around and I'm growing apart from my friend group due to new member's behaviors. I quickly fall back into the same lunch routine. 

One day three or four months into the school year was one of the few occasions that I got a school lunch, I go to eat at the normal place and some girl that I didn't know even went to my school, was in my spot. I could not fathom why she was sitting there, as I always sat there. I can't explain why it was my spot, except for the fact that my entire time at that school I sat there every day. Being the socially awkward guy I was, (and still am) I sat next to the pillar on the left side instead and said nothing of it. We made some small talk and after I finished I went inside like usual and went about my day helping out. She was sitting there the next day so we talk a little more, I learned her name and that we shared similar interests. (reading, video games, etc) To my surprise, she was also there the next day and the next day and the next. Over a month or two we become pretty close friends. She introduced me to her friends and I became friends with them. Before I even knew it had a whole new friend group that ate lunch with me every day. 

Her childhood friend who was a grade above us didn't like me much until we participated in LARP at the local comic book convention and hit each other over the head with foam swords. The person who I met at the convention had a friend group that took my little friend group in because of the two childhood friends I still keep in touch with most of the larger high school friend group(we all still play videogames together) including the girl who stole my lunch spot. 

I'm still salty about it and give her shit for taking my spot to this day.

36,happy,"My friends and I are generally cheapskates, as we were broke as all hell all the time. But one time in 10th grade, I went to school in a bad mood (not cranky or anything, just quieter and more spaced out than usual). Being the resident airhead in the group, it didnt make much of a difference than how I actually act, so I'd thought they wouldn't notice. However at lunchbreak, when I told them I was craving for chocolates out of the blue, they all bought one for me.

Well, all except my friend France (not her real name) because she didn't have enough cash. I told her it was fine and I appreciate the thought anyway.

It definitely improved my mood, but at home hours later, I hear a knock on my door, and it was France with a pack of double stuf oreos. This woman drove all the way to our house to give me a pack of oreos.

I told her she didn't have to, that her cheering me up at school was more than enough, but she told me she knows and just wanted to give it. I thanked her and we hung out for a bit before she drove home.

I'm happy for the free food, but more than that, I feel happy that they noticed such a subtle thing and cared enough to try to cheer me up. I love my friends so much!",1

38,happy,"**So before I begin with the story, I would like to clarify a few things about myself, that will be of use to you guys when reading this tale of mine...**

I have a full-time job working in a hypermarket where you can buy your everyday groceries (hypermarket is above the standard size of a supermarket in terms of the store, sales and more..), and I'm working with a team managing our shop, where we all have each our specific area to take care of when it comes to literally everything from sales to ordering, set-up in the shop, talking to salesmen, looking at numbers for each week sales, and so on... 
I've got the frozen department of our store, which I don't really mind because I don't feel the freezing temperature upon my skin, as I can literally walk around inside our -20 degrees freezer without even feeling it, whereas my co-workers would instantly retreat outside to get the warmth back. 
But nonetheless, I've been working there for about a year now, but just recently within the last month I received the frozen department as the manager of that and got to learn everything to run it, and I've always been that kind of Fox to give our customers the best enjoyment with shopping as they go by our section of the store (frozen, dairy, eggs and so on.., basically the cold area of the entire store) which led to this incident, that happened on recently in May.

So on that Wednesday I restocking on my 4 frozen aisles with numerous wares, and in the present time that we're living in with the virus, it's pretty difficult to avoid people when you had literally hundreds of customers buying groceries as you're working, but as I was restocking fries, I saw an elderly woman who had trouble with walking around probably because of her age or perhaps suffering from arthritis in her legs in a mild state, I'm not sure. Though I couldn't help but notice her struggle to get anything off the shelves and in her shopping cart, and as time went by, and when she reached the frozen section in the store, she tried to get a 5 kg pork tenderloin box we had on sale that week, (there were numerous loins packed inside a plastic bag and then sealed within a box that could withstand freezing temperature), and unfortunately, she couldn't lift the box 5 cm above its position, so I decided to go over and help her before any rude customer rushed her by, or pushed her away to get the box instead of her (I've seen those of actions before). When I approached her, she seemed rather surprised as if she had seen a ghost or something. (pretty difficult since our work clothes consist of a red shirt and black pants).

(OL = Old Lady) (M = me) 


*OL: ""Hello, do you work here??* 
*M: ""I do ma'am, do you require any help? I saw you had trouble with this ware of ours, so I immediately rushed over to find out if that was the case""* 
*OL: ""Yeah, I was trying to get that heavy box up and in the cart, as I'm planning to buy it today""* 
*M: ""I see, is it the tenderloin you want?""* (I asked even though I already saw her trying to pick it up, but still, I wanted to be sure, as customers could have a change of heart) 
*OL: ""Oh yes, could you be a dear and pick it up and put in the cart for me?""* 
*M: ""Sure, that'll be my pleasure""* So I did indeed help her out with the box of tenderloin, but after having carefully placed it in the cart next to her other groceries, she didn't even hesitate to ask me for more help. 
*OL: ""Thank you, young man, I know you're probably busy, but could you help me out more?""* even though I did have my hands full at the moment with wares to be restocked, I didn't want to neglect the old lady, and it would also be shown as poor business service, so I decided to agree upon her request. 
*M: ""I'll gladly help you out""*

Little did I know that she had an entire shopping list to go through before heading for the cashier, but I wouldn't feel right to just refuse to help her when she clearly needed it, and throughout the list, there were multiple items that were quite heavy even for her, so I could see why she wanted the help. Some of the items were around 8-10 kg, and I imagined how horrific it would have been if she tried to lift a 10 kg item of a shelf when she barely could lift a 5 kg item, but after 15 minutes of us going around finding her groceries, I told her, that I had to inform my colleagues down at the cold section of the store to keep an eye on the frozen aisles just in case of restocking, which she didn't mind at all, so I phoned them and told my current whereabouts and predicament. 
As the minutes went by she told me everything about her situation with her husband, and how it was originally him, who were supposed to shop for both of them since she was barely able to do in her condition, but he had apparently fallen quite ill (not the virus) and couldn't leave his bed at all, and they were running out of groceries, so she had to step up even though it would be quite difficult, though she had hoped to acquire help from a worker within the facility, and that would be me.

Having finished the shopping list and heading towards the cashier, I decided to help her out more by getting every single item on the conveyor and even told my co-worker of the situation, and by my fortunate soul, a lot of other customers around us overheard what I was saying (even though I tried to speak very low) and gave me good remarks and compliments about the ordeal with me helping out the old lady. While she was paying for her groceries, I bagged everything in shopping bags (which she didn't have to buy because I was feeling generous and let the old lady have that extra goodness to make her day even better, whom my co-worker understood and acknowledge to simply not scan the bags for her)When everything was done and bagged up, I helped out her outside of our store with me driving the cart with all of the heavy bags inside, while she was walking right next to me, but I had a bad feeling once we reached outside, as she didn't appear to show me where her car was nor how she was going to transport everything back home.

*M: ""So where's your vehicle, ma'am?""* 
*OL: ""I don't have any since I can't drive anymore, only my husband can, so I took the bus here""* 
*M: ""I see, do you have anyone who can help you carry your groceries and also once you get inside your home upon arriving there?""* it's a bit odd question to ask her as a shop manager of a certain department, but in her state and with her husband being bedridden, how was she supposed to carry everything from here to her home. 
*OL: ""No one besides my husband, but as I've said to you earlier, he's currently very ill, so I'll just have to manage by myself""* I couldn't let that happened, it would be too much for her to handle in one way trip and even carry while being on the bus, so I came up with an idea on the spot that seemed rather drastic, but I really wanted to help her out. 
*M: ""If it's possible, would it be alright with you, if I talked with my boss to use my lunch break to help you getting home with your groceries, and also carrying them inside for you as well?""* she was completely stunned by my offer and didn't know what to say at first. 
*OL: ""But wouldn't that be a bother to you since you're at work, and I'm taking your time?""* 
*M: ""Not to me ma'am, but I'm going have to speak with my boss first, can't just leave my workplace without anyone knowing""* 
*OL: ""You go right ahead, young man, I'll wait here with the cart until you've returned""*

So I quickly ran back inside and head for the office to talk with my boss about the whole thing, and luckily since he's the best boss I could ever ask for, he agreed to let me help the old lady even more, and it didn't even have to affect my lunch break, and he would even inform my co-workers down at the cold area what's happening. So I immediately grabbed my car keys and rushed out to her in rapid fashion, as she was still waiting at the same spot I left her at. 
Upon meeting her again, a lot of other customers had apparently talked to her, since they found it very odd for her to stand alone with the cart and waiting for something to happen, in which she had explained the whole ordeal to them within the timespan I was gone to talk to my boss. So when they saw me standing next to her, they complimented me and said nice things about how great employees we were to our customers, so I couldn't help but feel completely satisfied with myself. 
I explained to the old lady the permission to leave my workplace to help her, and she was overjoyed and her expression lit up like a Christmas tree, so we drove the cart towards my car and stuffed it with her groceries while still keeping a seat available for her to be comfortable. I drove off with her directing me towards her home, and luckily it was only 10 min. away in the car, and upon arriving there, I helped out by carrying everything inside for her, while her husband was shouting from his bed about what the commotion was about, in which the old lady told him everything. 
It only took me a couple of minutes to unload everything and get it inside their home and after the last haul, she was utterly grateful towards the honorable deed I've done for them, and they would never forget it, neither did I.I even offered to buy groceries for them until the husband was fit again to do so, which they kindly took to heart and accepted, so we exchanged numbers, so they could in contact with me with details of their next shopping list.

Within the next few days, the store received a lot of attention from social media because of what I did, and my boss was beyond thrilled, so he gave me a 50$ gift card, which I could use in the shop I worked at. Last Friday I received a phone call from the old lady, while I was at work, who had a small shopping list they wished for me to buy in the store, and once work was done and I had bought their groceries, they actually gave me a tiny present, which I had to open when I got home. So once I got home and opened the present, there was a card which read: 
*""Many thanks for your generosity upon the day you helped my wife with everything, we never expected to get such lovely support from anyone during our situation, and for that, we're forever grateful, so in the present along with this card you're reading, is a small token of our appreciation for your hard work and helpfulness towards us, - Love Husband and Old Lady - ""* 
In the present were 200$ dollars and an experience card of my choice. (the ones you buy to try out a specific event such a traveling in an air balloon, having brunch in a lucrative hotel, and so on..)",0
39,happy,"My friend LOVES d&d. Her whole family plays often, our parents are friends and her older brother is also friends with my sister. She's also friends with my sister, because she knew her before me. My county is in phase 2 of quarantine now, meaning my sister has been at their house some. The brother was planning to run a game pretty soon, and everyone was down. Although, my friend insisted she didn't want to play unless I would. Out of character, because like I said she loves the game and plays a lot. I've only played with them once, I'm the youngest in their group and was new so I was sort of withdrawn. So, I think she did that because she wants to include me and that made me really happy.

""You know me too well bruh"" and idk it wasn't a huge gesture or anything remotely like the stories i read here but it just melted my heart. Like i cried after that ?

43,happy,"So this is definitely kinda ordinary but it's wholesome to me. So 5 years ago I (female)moved 8 hours away from my home town I was still in my single digits age wise. I lost contact with all of my friends except for one. I had a friend named (fake name) Asher we lost touch when I moved and we had no way to stay in contact really and eventually I brushed him aside but kept him in the back of my mind and talked about him occasionally. Then after five years of no contact I start having the same memory in my dreams for a week. I was at his mom's hair salon getting a trim and layers and then we went to this really fun mall. So two nights ago I started digging around and found out where her hair salon was and went off of that. More digging and I find a place matching the town and I decided to check that one out. The pictures somewhat matched but not exactly so I went on the all knowing Facebook and looked up the place that looked like the memory. I'm looking through pics when I find a video of the place I thought excitedly ""if she goes down that hallway and there are two chairs to the left and a row of them to the right this is the place."" And sure enough that's exactly what I saw so I sent her a message with my email and name explained that I used to know her son and wanted to get back in touch. Two minutes go by and she replies that she went through his papers and was about to email my mom and after that I started talking to Asher again and playing video games together and I hope to see him sometime this summer after five long years. I hope you found this story interesting and I want you to remember if you keep remembering someone reach out it might end up with a old friendship sparking again. Fate exists, at least it does for us.",1
44,happy,"This isn't a great story, but I just wanted to post **something**.

Note that I don't remember this story, my mom told me this recently, so the facts might not be completely straight.

When I was 4 yrs old, I used to have this Ben 10 watch (Still have it, just broken now) because I loved the show (though the reboot is something I don't wanna talk about). I was somewhere in public, like the airport, or the park. This other kid saw my watch and walked towards me. I think he was somewhere around 4 as well. He liked Ben 10 too. He and I were talking about the watch, but the thing was, he was French. I am from Africa and am only fluent in English, but I know a handful of Arabic and Spanish. Not French. So we were just talking to each other, not taking in a word that the other was saying. We only bonded over the watch. My mom thought that it was so cute that I was playing with some kid I didn't even know over a watch.


Like I said before, not a great story. If you liked it, your welcome.

46,happy,"Let me tell you about a story. This is something that forever changed me, and frankly, is the only reason my life is worth living. I was living my miserable life, working minimum wage at a three star restaurant. How I ended up here is not very interesting. My whole life had been a downward spiral since my senior year at high school. All it took were a few parties here and there, mixing in with the wrong crowd for a couple years, and getting a DUI. To top everything off, I got in a car accident. All of the carefully stacked cards that made up my life came tumbling down. It�s funny, isn�t it? Human social life is a fragile thing, yet it�s the most important thing you could get. All it takes is one mistake. Just one, before you are stuck in a hole with no way out but to grit your teeth and dig deeper hoping you might find something.

For me, I never found anything. Every Christmas, instead of having fun, I would cry. I would cry thinking about the fun everyone else was having, while I was sitting down on my couch all by myself, reminiscing on the times where life was bearable. I would remember the times where I sat next to my mum, feeling the warmth of the fireplace gently tugging me into a deep sleep, while the laughter of my family pulled me back. I would go to sleep on christmas eve and wake up the next day hoping there was something, anything, next to the fireplace. But just like every year, there was nothing. Not even coal. At least with coal I could light a torch and brighten the path that I dug out. But there was nothing. Nothing to keep me going when times were tough. Nothing to fall back on. It wasn�t long before digging was too exhausting. Reality kicked in, where no, you can�t just be whatever you want to be if you put your mind to it. Sometimes, it�s just too late to push forward, where you have overwhelmingly more risk than reward.

Just like that, I became a drifter. I wandered around, finding a place that I could begin to call home. Nothing mattered, but making sure I had what I needed to survive. It took some time, but after a while I was able to land a job, which I currently work at. It took even longer to get an apartment. The apartment I was able to get was a literal ruin. There were parts in the wall where you could see the frame of the building. Not to mention it smelled like the place itself was rotting. There were patches of mildew frosted everywhere. Deciding that the world didn't give a crap about my situation, and no amount of complaining was going to help me, I adapted to the place. Eventually, after throwing hundreds of dollars that I wouldn't ever get back, it felt more and more cozy. Slowly, as my financial situation improved, I could afford to think about the small things in life. Throughout this though, it wasn�t all roses and sunshine. As if life was telling me to give up, my dad died. It was labeled as a natural death. What is natural about having your parents taken away from you at such a young age? My dad was only 51 when he died of a heart attack. I was in too much pain to bear the outside world, so I locked myself in my room. I didn't come out until my Mom came over and practically begged me to come out. �You�re hurting yourself son. I get that you are hurting inside, but don't make that hurt yourself even more. Please�, she pleaded. I didn't care much for myself, but I couldn't bear to see my mom in pain, so I left my room.

Their deaths hit me hard. My dad dying was devastating, but my mom's death was what pushed it. She died soon after my dad did. The two days only months apart. I became lost again, finding joy in nothing. Everything was cold and dead. At this point, I went into a recession. I was already living on the edge, and now I was knocked over to the other side. The last time, I had my mom to pull me back, but this time I had no one. The other side was a weird sort of place. It was where it seemed like my body was on autopilot. I wasn't in full control of my actions. At first, I rarely left my room, only coming out to eat or use the bathroom. Life was the cycle of waking up at 3 in the morning, not being able to sleep, going to work, coming home late at 7, eating, and going to sleep. There were times where no matter where I was or what I was doing, I would have liked nothing more than to curl up into a ball and wither off into space, lost among the vast darkness. I would cry myself to sleep, drowning myself in tears of self pity. It felt like everything was hopeless, that there was no escape from the pain.

One day, as I was going through the long dull trek that I went everyday to go to work. It was so habitual that I could have gone there with my eyes closed. This time, it was different. As the road fencing ended, there would usually be two options for me. Take a left, and walk about another half mile or so. Then where I work is no more than 200 meters to the right. The other option is take a left, and walk about 300 meters straight into a dead end, with fencing at the end of the road, nowhere else to go.

Today, instead of making a left, I took a right. This time, I heard a voice. It was a deep, booming voice that made the ground under me vibrate. �Life is not free, so you will never get another chance. Except for this one. Come into the woods, and find the door if you want to get a second chance.�, it said. Now, it wasn't as if my body was being controlled or anything. Every step I took was deliberate. It was more as if I was drawn to it. I wanted to go that way. I knew from the bottom of my soul that the voice that promised relief from all the pain, a second chance, was honest. That made me determined. There was also something about the woods that made me uneasy though. My determination finally won over after some time, and I went ahead. The moment I stepped foot into the woods, there was an icy feeling in the air, and I shuddered with every step. The more I walked, the more I got that feeling of dread. At some point, after a long time of hacking through the woods with my bare hands, I couldn't take the dread anymore. I decided to turn back, regret filling my every move. Just as I was about to turn back, I felt a strange feeling. It was small at first, barely noticeable. As time passed I couldn't ignore it however.

It was my responsibility. I felt responsible for my own life. I owed it to myself to do anything and everything in my power to fix it, to become a better person. I slowly got angry at myself for turning back. Angry at myself for being content with this bland and pitiful life I had been living. Angry for not doing enough to help those around me. Anger at myself for not being my mom�s side in her last months. This anger is what made me keep going. The green forest was mesmerizing, with vivid shades of green, and bright colored fruits and berries popping in contrast. I was surprised. How was something like this unnoticed by any of the locals?

As I went farther and my eyes adjusted to the change in scenery, I began to notice other people. The more my vision adjusted to the change, the more people were apparent. It was like a huge sea of bodies. There were probably thousands. It was scary, knowing that so many other people wanted a second chance like I did. Knowing that this was a race, I sped up. The others had the same idea I did, and they did the same, and soon I was full out sprinting. It was a race, with a prize bigger than any gold medal. I was sprinting for what felt like hours, and some superhuman determination and strength overtook me. The burning of my calfs slowly fading away into another wave of intense pain. I was racing ahead of the pack. Soon, the thick wave of bodies lessened. I ran and ran. I ran until I was wheezing from the pollen, and then I ran even harder. After a while, I stole a few glances around me while running, and saw no one else. I was excited. This meant I had a chance at fixing my life!

*Bam*. I slammed head first into a plain white door. How had I failed to see this? It stuck out so much in the green surroundings, and it looked brand new, with none of the wear and tear you would expect a door in the middle of woods to get. The door emanated a sort of warm, positive energy that made me feel happy for the first time in so long. I don't know why, but I was completely confident that whatever awaited me behind the door wast a trap, that I would help me. With a smile plastered on my face, I opened the door, and it was the last thing I remembered from the forest.

I woke up, my head throbbing with pain. I looked around, but there was nothing but pure void. A loud, booming voice ruptured the silence, �Well, this is Ironic. You seemed the most angry at yourself, but you were also the one with the most determination to change. How interesting�. �Wh-...where am I?�, I stuttered. I recognized the voice. It was the same voice calling me into the woods. �You tell me.�, the entity replied. �I�m dead, aren�t I?�, I guessed. The entity laughed a deep warm laugh that made me feel warm inside, for the first time in forever. �No, you are definitely nor dead. In fact, you are more alive than you have ever been in the last 10 years.�. �What do you mean by that?�, I nervously asked. �You�ll see. Until then, you�re not going anywhere, life has so much more to give. Just try not mess up again, ok?�, the entity assured me. Just like that, there was nothing left but darkness. It was like this for a while, with nothing changing.

A blinding light pierced the dark.

The light was my whole life, everything I had done up to this point was all contained in that light. From the light, a line shot out. My lifeline, the one hting to tether me to the normal world and to bring me back. I had to get that, or I would die. Suddenly, my entire body was united, and with one purpose, to grab hold of the line. I ran as fast as I could. The line was miles away. I could tell it was, but it was my life. The same life I wasted due to reckless choices and self pity. I ran and ran. I ran for literal years. It was the universe's final way to test me. My feet pounded on the ground over and over with the same thud.

I felt my muscles tearing, my ligaments snapping one by one. My bones were crunching from bottom to the top due to the constant friction. My chest was pounding, my heart was tirelessly pumping blood, threatening to tear and brust any moment. After so much, my body gave out. My vision faded. The world was blacking out. I wanted to give up, to surrender to the cold darkness. It would probably be painless, in fact it would be much easier. But I couldn't go down without a fight, not like I had all my life. Not again. I slipped, tumbled, crashed, and stumbled. I never once did stop. I kept on going. The last 50 yards, I practically crawled. In the end, I made it. As my fingers touched the light, warmth burst through my body. My soul lit on fire. My fingertips tingled. I was alive.

I woke up in a white bed, needles sticking out me. Looking down at myself, I felt a strange feeling of deja vu. It hurt to even move. The light from the outside world blinded me, causing me to wince in pain. I looked through the window on the door leading out the room, and saw my moms face peering at me through the glass, elated that I was awake. Something felt off though. I overheard one of the nurses whispering, �Good thing his body is young, any older and he would have died�. Wait, what? How could they consider me young? I�d always considered thirty to be middle aged. Wait, hold up. I saw my mom through the glass... my mom.

There was one problem. She died. Wait, she also doesn't have stress marks on her face. She had it tough as well when dad died. Suddenly, everything fell into place. My mom being alive, her also not having stress marks on her face, the nurses calling me young, why I felt the strange sense of deja vu when I first woke up. This was back when I got injured while hiking with my friends freshman year of college. I had travelled back in time.

So, this is my story. This is where my story here ends, but also where a new one starts. A brighter one. I had an entity looking out for me, deciding through reasons unknown to me, that I was worth saving. It chose to give me a second chance at life. If you are reading this, I'm eternally thankful. You gave me what no one else has gotten. You gave me something more meaningful than anything money can buy you. A second chance at life. To this day I'm still confused as to the entity's purpose, but that doesn't matter anymore. If my life was important enough to be saved, anyones is. Never give up on your life. Unlike what happened for me, you only get one shot at it. Don't mess up your life, thinking it's not important, because if there's one thing this experience has taught me, is that it is. Your life matters.",1
47,happy,"So when I was around 11-12 years old, I was in a little rock band with a few of my friends. I played rhythm guitar, my best friend played drums, my cousin played lead guitar, one of my cousins friends sang, and another one of my friends played bass. We had a lot of fun playing together and usually met up at my best friends house because he had a ""music room"" with equipment and soundproof padding (his dad was really into music as well as his brother) the singer (she did have a really nice voice for her age) did not like are bassist, but they never really argued. One time, his parents were on vacation and we were playing a mix of Linkin Park and greenday most likely, because teenagers, and the bassist suggested we play killing in the name of by rage against the machine. I personally wanted to, the drummer and lead guitarist were down for it, but the singer didn't want to. So her and the bassist got into an argument and it ended with her winning because he didn't want to fight over it. When we all went home we studied the tabs for the song he wanted to play, in Wich he already knew. The next day we went back to his house and our singer decided she wanted to sing seven Nation army, so we prepped up and we're about to play. Imagine her surprise when she finishes the count off, and instead of hearing the white strips, she heard R.A.T.M. she got extremely mad and refused to sing, however we kept playing. The bassist was extremely happy. We probably should of told him what we were doing, because b
He started playing the song she suggested, but he quickly realized what was going on and joined in. Later on the singer left and we quickly replaced her with this guy from the school choir and we never really argued after that",1
48,happy,"2.5 months ago I took a job as GM at a bar and restaurant. They had fired the previous manager and brought me in the day after my interview on the 4th of July, the BUSIEST weekend of the year for us,

Most of the employees I know and love like family now, were all about to quit because they wanted the old manager back. The moment I knew I became family was this:

Since the day I started I had this hard plastic reusable water bottle I carried everywhere. Because stay hydrated and protect the earth right!? And every day I made sure to tell my employees at least twice how valuable, vibrant, and wonderful of people they are. So one day I let my employees go early and closed by myself because they deserved an early night. I accidentally dropped my bottle/cup and it shattered into a million pieces in front of me. I immediately had to snap my distress to our work group in sadness.

Two days later one of my bartenders walks into work and hands me a Starbucks bag saying, �just read the note on top first.� The note literally said, �Ypu appreciate us so much, and we know how much you loved your mug. So we bought you a new one.�

I pulled out a black aluminum SB mug from the bag and proceeded to bawl my eyes out for a solid 20 minutes.",1
49,happy,"So with everything going on and with my own issues I'm stressed to say the least. My intelligent and very observant 5yr old boy has taken notice. Bed time rolls around and my kids are being kids. Bouncing around while I'm trying to read. We get through the bed time story and I am then attacked with a barrage of ""mommy"" every time I try to close the door. I get them settled and just as I'm closing the door my son pipes up. ""Mommy?""

""Yeah buddy?""

""I got a secret.""

At this point I'm just so tired and sigh figuring he's going to do like I do with him when I tell him I have a secret and tell him the secret is that I love him. Nope.

""Okay bud what's your secret?""

He giggles and lays down pulling his blanket up. ""You make me happy mommy.""

I paused for a moment processing and just smile. ""Thanks buddy.""

I then shut the door and sat down at my computer about to cry because it just made the entire drawn out day and my constant battle with my own issues while raising my kids completely and totally worth it. My son knows I struggle with mental illness. He also knows, because I cannot stress it enough to him, that he is not responsible for taking care of mommy in any way shape or form. That it is mommy's job to take care of him and his sister. So when he notices I am stressed out and/or depressed/anxious (and believe me I've had years of practice hiding it). He will drop little lines like that on me all the time or snuggle up with me and just sit/lay there just because and it never fails to make me smile and feel just a little bit better.",1

Okay. So. My SO and I live on the back end of a house. Shared parking is also at the back of the house. Also, it's nice enough right now that ALL of our windows are open. Now, our neighbors in the front are younger than us and all college women. One of them has a very sweet boyfriend who is always super excited to see and let our dog (who is super friendly and loves the attention).
Alright. So, this evening my SO and I are enjoying our nice and quiet reading time. The dog is napping by the glass front door, when the neighbors boyfriend drives in blasting some slow jam on his radio. Neither of us mind, since we're used to it at this point. He proceeds to get out of the car, the dog stands at the door staring at him, and my SO and I continue reading on the couch out of sight. Well, the guy gets out of the car half-heartedly singing the chorus ""When you say nothing at all"". Then stops at the sight of our dog, and whole-heartedly finishes out the chorus...to our dog. Both my SO and I are completely stunned and tried so hard to cover any giggles. But honestly, it was the sweetest thing. I'm a crier when I laugh hard enough, and by the time he had passed out open windows, tears where rolling down my face. It was precious and funny and just the nicest thing. We love our dog a ton, but this makes it even better that he brings so much joy to others too.",1
51,happy,"So at my work I go reunited with a old bully of mine in the hospital in the behavioral health area. A bit of back story I work at a hospital as a patient transporter (I am the staff that moves patients and equipment around the hospital) and at my hospital transports also clean the rooms of patients that are transferred or discharged. About a month ago I was cleaning a room in the behavioral heath section of of the hospital and in my hospital we have semi privet rooms. I was cleaning one side of the discharged patient while the other patient was on his bed as he watched me but to me when I saw him he looked familiar but I couldn�t quite tell where I knew him from until he saw my name tag. He then recognized it and he asked me about it and if I went to a certain school and I said yes and I ask his name and he tells me and I recognized him as he was much skinnier, paler, and he was very different to when I last saw him and he was constantly shivering and shaking. He and I were extremely surprised to see each other after so long since we seen each other and he was extremely sorry for how he treated me in the past he felt guilty in what he done back then and I wont go into to many details about it here. I roughly told him it was all in the past and that I forgave him and all that happened I could see in his eyes that it meant all lot to him to hear those words we talked for a bit while I cleaned the room catching up and making small talk and when I finished up I reassured him that I am not mad at him I forgive him and though right now things are hard but I gave him a hug and left. 
A few days later I came when they were doing a visitation and I came on a day I had off and I surprised him and his mom was visiting at the time so i met her too and we talked more about life and I gave him advise. As I learned more about him as bits and pieces of why he�s there, his broken family, his problem with drugs, and history of violence and it hurt me to hear it as I comforted him and told him ways to turn around his life and in my mind I think it helped but as soon as the visitations are back I will try to see him again.",1
52,happy,"Recently, I've come to be close friends with an ex boss of mine. She's the sweetest person in the world and just an awesome person in general. Well, the reason I say ex boss is because she got fired. The whole crew quit after she got fired, and I was part of that. Recently, I've been hanging out with her and her family just because there's nothing better to do. But this one night, we were so bored and had nothing to do so we decided to get drunk and high. Our mutual idea while under the influence of both was to dye our hair. Me being more messed up than her led her to do my hair for me. I have never felt such love and care in my life until she put her hands on me. I was so drunk and high and had no recognition of what was going on. But what I was fully aware of was the way she was caressing my hair. After we applied the dye, we took separate showers and cleaned up. And whenever I asked her for a blow drier for me, she offered to help me dry it. And again, the way she was so gentle with my hair felt so warm and comforting. I can't quite place words for what I felt that night. But i gave her a hug and told her she means too much to me and that I would never wish harm upon her soul. I just thought I would share of this warm moment of bliss I encountered. Where all my problems were gone once I was there sitting on the bathroom floor with a person I just met stoned and drunk out of my mind getting my hair dyed and just talking about how I'm not fucked up at all.( also this was my first time drinking alcohol and first time in months smoking weed again so you can probably tell I was pretty messed up. But it was so worth the experience )",1
53,happy,"My English teacher is simply one of the best human beings I have ever met. I'd like to think of her as the grandmother I didn't have. I often come up to her room during lunch whenever I could, because of my high school schedule. Whenever I would come up there, she'd tell me stories about her life and whatever is going on, or simply how she's doing.

I've opened up to her more than I ever could to someone a lot older. I tell her all of my deepest and darkest secrets and stories I wouldn't dare to tell anyone. She's like my guardian. My protector. My haven. The safest place I go to.....",1
54,happy,"I met my partner during middle school. We were a lot younger, awkward, but still friendly with one another. He was more on the popular side, I was more on the geeky/awkward people side. Our middle school had dances monthly and he�d come to do whatever dumb nonsense boys did back then, like running around or getting himself into something. Eventually he had to move away and I didn�t realize for a long time. 

Freshman year passed and I had my very first, at least what I thought I had, high school sweetheart. The guy�s a douche. Left me over text. Then one night, my partner posted something he had a good question for. I slid up, answered it for him, and we started talking from then on. 

Over the next 8 months, we�ve had no idea what would�ve came to us. I thought he was temporary. He did too. We did everything together. He turned into my best friend, my protector, and my life. We did a lot together and we had each other�s backs. I didn�t know what or how someone should be treated until I met him, because of how toxic my relationships were my entire life. 

We learned a lot from each other. How to open up to each other. How to protect your own partner. How to take care of someone who loves you the same. 

A thing I noticed he did was remembering every little thing I do. Whenever I�d get upset, he�d notice I�d stay quiet for 2 minutes. He�d notice whenever I get happy, my smile lights up. He noticed when I�d feel afraid I�d stuff my face in a pillow or a stuffed animal. He also knows the sleeping position I�d sleep in.

I love my partner.",1
55,happy,"Recently my cousin got a phone and hes a year younger than me. He finnaly understood the joy I receive from laughing at memes. His mom set his age to twelve even though hes turning 14 next month since she knows I watch r/Antivaxx videos on my phone and she wants to keep him in her web of lies for as long as she can so he can only use youtube kids and get apps that she approves of (so no reddit).

So in order to get memes he googles them, finds funny ones, screenshots and even goes through the effort of cropping them. At exactly 11 he sends me a message that says ""meme
hurricane"" which warns me that hes going to spam me with memes so I turn off notifications. an hour later I go to his messages and turn notifications for him back on. 

I see memes from 2012-2016 and recent but he sends a lot of dead memes. I used to get annoyed but I realised this is his way of enjoying memes since he cant get new ones, I laugh along with him at the nostalgia because I used to Google lol cat nemes when I was 10 and in exchange I send him a meme of hurricanes that I get from reddit and other websites.

It was an 80 year old lady and needed Claritin, but couldn�t go herself, so I donned my protection gloves, and went to her house, in her mail slot, it had an envelope that said hardcore-spatula. (It didn�t, but it had my actual name on it) it had 20 bucks in it, and I headed off for the local star market. It was way more packed than it had probably ever been, I was listening to music , and I was muttering song lyrics without realizing it. But I found the Claritin, but saw the wrong amount, I was about to ask and employee, but I saw one with the right amount, and took it, and when I got into the line, there was this old couple with masks on, with so much fucking stuff, but no toilet paper, an I right? Nah, but this dude asked me if I wanted to go in front of him in a line that was going quicker, I said no because I only had one thing, so I said no. (Probably not the best idea, but whatever) I went and checked out, there was this huge ass glass panel in front of the cashier, but that is normal, I checked out and all that Jazz, then walked over to her house and gave it to her. I rang the doorbell, then waited. And waited. And then she answered, my hand was about to hit the doorbell again, but I gave it to her, she was super quiet, I can�t say this for sure, but I don�t have hearing loss, but I don�t have good hearing, also, I have tinnitus.

My boss told me not to worry I will be okay. And he said when it goes away and we can work again he wants me to be there, I asked him why because i am not very important 

my boss said i am wrong and i am very important and needed. Without dish washers the restauran wont work. without dish washers there arent any clean dishes and without any dishes the cooks have nothing to put food on . And withoutt dishe washers there are no clean pots and pans to cook with and witout pots and pans no food can be cooked And without food being cook there is nothing to give customers . And without customers its just a empty building.

So he needs me to come back be proud of what i do. Just dont goof off to get what i want . that made me laugh. I told him I would never do that. He said to remember how needed i am and they would all miss me if i wasnt there. That made me really happy and I said good bye and i will be there.

63,happy,"I made a post in KidsAreFuckingSmart about how my 5yr old boy found a way to help his delayed autistic sister over the course of a year and can now help her with her work most of the time without her screaming in his face about it by making her think she is helping him. Got some posts telling me how wholesome it was. My son is extremely intelligent. He's a problem solver, extremely empathetic and emotional. He's a complete and total mama's boy. As much of a total ass as he is, and he's a kid so ya know he is, he's also very loving and affectionate. My son picked up very early on(probably around 3yrs old) that some was off with mommy. I have sever anxiety and depression along with a whole goodie bag of mental health problems. I am medicated and was in therapy but can't afford therapy so yeah. When he was around 4 and my depression would get too bad and my son would ask if i was okay. 

Him: ""You okay?""

Me: ""I'm fine mommy is just not feeling to good.""

Him: ""You sick?"". Note he knew I was taking meds just not why.

Me: ""sort of buddy. Mommy has depression and it's kind of like being really sad only it doesn't go away and mommy has a hard time just getting out of bed some days.

Him: ""You are depressed? Why?""

Me: ""I don't know buddy. I wish I did. Mommy's brain doesn't make the happy stuff so she takes medicine for it.""

Him: ""Did you take the happy medicine?""

Me: ""I did. But sometimes mommy just has really bad days.""

Him: ""Today is a bad day? why?

Me: ""For mommy it's just a bad day. I don't know why buddy. You know how mommy always tells you and you sister to tell her what is wrong so mommy can fix it?"" He nods ""Well mommy doesn't know what's wrong so she can't fix it. All she can do is take her medicine.""

Him: ""So the booboo is in your head? Like the headaches?"" (note I get really bad headaches and migraines pretty frequently.)

Me: ""In my brain but yeah buddy something like that.""

Long silence with him just standing there staring at me laying on my bed.

Him: ""You know what?""

Me: ""What's that buddy?""

Him: ""I wanna cuddle.""

Me: ""Really? Right now? Like literally every other time I want to cuddle you and you are a butt about it and you want to cuddle right now?""

Him: ""Yep""

I move over so he can crawl into bed with me.

Him: ""Mommy we need a blanket.""

Me: ""Then grab a blanket kid cause I'm not moving.""

He happily gets back up and grabs all the blankets spreads them out on top of me then crawls back into bed and covers himself up too.

Him: ""See? Now I can help your brain booboo."" Silence. ""This is nice.""

Me: ""Yeah this is nice. Thank you buddy.""

He will literally lay there with me until I can get myself up and moving. Sometimes he'll even grab one of his books to read to me as well. And before anyone says anything. I've told him more time than I can count he is not responsible for taking care of me. It's mommy's job to take care of him and his sister not the other way around.

64,happy,"So I have other posts and it talks about my son a lot more than my daughter. Didn't wanna be like I favor him more than her because I don't. She is 8yrs old. Developmentally and speech delayed and autistic. She can be a handful. Things would be so much easier with her if she could communicate. While her communication has gotten better she's still so far behind. But this story is from when she was about 4yr old. She barely spoke, mostly just screams and babbles. God forbid you try to hug or cuddle her because she was not about the cuddling life(her autism. For a while I took it personally and thought she didn't love me). She was not a very lovey dovey kid(still isn't really). And at this point it never dawned on me that she might be autistic. Her father just kept insisting she was fine and was just being defiant. His g/f knew some ASL and had the same feeling that I did about my daughter, that she actually had problems.

To set the scene. I hadn't met my current g/f yet. I wasn't medicated. Hadn't gone to therapy. Was still married and my(at the time) husband has his side chick living with us. I was in a dark place and at the end of my rope. I crashed and hit a low point, a place I hadn't been since I was pregnant with my daughter. I was sitting on the kitchen floor holding a knife in my hand. It felt like I was sitting there forever with tears down my face quietly sobbing. Everyone was asleep. I broke down and tossed the knife on the counter unable to do it(was still alone at this point) and just curled up and cried. I looked up for a second feeling like I was being stared at and saw my daughter standing there(sneak little ninja that she is). Now she doesn't look directly at people very often and never for long periods of time when she does. But there she was just standing there staring at me with this old soulful eyes. She walked over to me and I quickly tried to clean up my face and try to stand up only to be stopped by her crawling up into my lap and curling up there. She reached up her hand around my head and pulled it down to I was resting my head on her head. I wrapped her up in my arms and just cried. She sat there in my lap holding onto me and patting the back of my head. It was at that point I realized how much she loved me and that she just has problems showing it. I told her I loved her so much. She looked down at her free hand and carefully managed to sign ""I love you"" to me. I then picked her up and took her back to bed and tucked her in. When I tried to leave she ""squawked"" at me and I ended up crawling in bed with her and slept in her bed that night. Woke up almost on the floor the next morning because she's an aggressive sleeper like me but she's smaller lol.",1
65,happy,"Hi, I�m 16 and for my whole life, I never saw my father. I�m a single child and my mom and my dad got divorced before I was born. I always bring up my seeing my dad to my mom but my mom always changed the subject or said: �If he ever wanted to see you he would see you.�


My mom has her office in the basement and whenever she forgot something from downstairs, she�ll have me go down and get it. One night years ago (about 2-3 years ago) she forgot something in her filing cabinet. That was when I came across the divorce papers. I started searching through to find something about my father. The only thing I could find was an address. A month later I brought it up with her and she told me that the last time she knew of him was when he was moving down to Tennessee. So I kind of lost hope when she said that.�


I got my first phone in the middle of my freshman year. I saved the address on my phone so maybe I could go to it one day. Two weeks ago, I had my license for a while and so I told my self that I was going to the address on a certain day.


I had to find some way to not tell my mom that I was going to see my dad, so I made the excuse that I was going to be hanging out with friends the whole day. I didn�t know what I was getting myself into. The only information I have about my dad was from my mother, she said he was a lazy drunk who never helped around the house. Out of everything I heard about him, I still wanted to see him. I only had the address to go to, and there could be a chance he wasn�t there, but I drove over an hour to that location.


Every mile I made I was thinking to myself �What am I doing?�, but I kept ongoing. I was going behind my mom�s back which is something I never did. To give you a preference of how far I had to drive and the time I had to rethink everything I was doing, I live in a small town called Maineville Ohio, he lived in a small town called Verona Ohio past Dayton. That�s 1 hr and 16 min of me driving at the age of 16 going to a place I don�t know what to expect from behind my mom�s back.�


Once I got there, I knocked on the door and his wife answered the door. She said, �Hello, is there anything I can help you with?�

�Yeah, I�m 5 Elements. Is Mr. Elements here?�

She led me inside and opened a door to where my father was sitting on a bed. I said nothing, I just started crying. He got up and gave me a hug. All I could do was give him a hug. After a while, he sat down with me He told me his side of the story. He was working every day for long hours and rarely had anytime to be with my mom. My mom was in school working to become a teacher. He told me how he only sees her once a week, and when he was there, she�ll always ignore him, go out with friends or volunteer at various locations. He told me that they had similarities but yet different. He didn�t want to bring me back and forth cause he didn�t want to make me feel that he was only picking me up just because he had to, cause he grew up like that with his brother and two sisters. He knew that it was the best choice to leave me with my mom. That was when we both got each other�s numbers so we could stay in contact. I just have to keep him a secret from my mom.


Now I�m thinking to myself, what if I never went and took my chances of seeing him. I now have a whole new side of the family I have yet to meet. If I haven�t gone to that location I wouldn�t have known that Diabetes runs though my family, That I�m an uncle to my halfsisters kid, and I wouldn�t have known that he actually did still love me.�",1

67,happy,"So I've been on reddit for a year or two and the first time this has happened to me so sorry if my storytelling horrible, but here's some backstory I'm in grade ten, live in Canada and just got home from a long day I live in a town with like 50-100 people so it's not that interesting and I come home to my computer open it up and start up Spotify listen to sum tunes while playing some terraria and my tone goes off ""Za Wardo"" (I'm a Jojo fanatic so cringe heh) and look and see a random number and let's call her Nicole and she texts me ""hey is this Derek"" (not real name) and I say no this is Mac (my nickname because my names weird) and she says oh sorry must've Gotten the wrong number and how she was down in the dumps and just wanted to text Derek and how this was his old number (backstory I have never been depressed but I know I probably will be because I'm delaying it but I know how it felt so I tried saying some incoregement and how I'm there for her) so we talk and she's about 30 and I haven't realised my age (still haven't) and she told me that I really cheered her up and how she was down in the dumps after like a hour and a half of talking and we became friends to this day (this happend on about March 13th 2020 Sask Regina time) couple days Laker like the 15th she shows me a picture of her doggo and I call it cute (what else I'm sposed to do) and I tell her I got stuff to do (photoshop freelance etc) and I head off and we haven't talked again yet it may sound farfetched but if you all don't believe me Ill edit and post pictures of our convo (numbers blurred out obisly)",0
68,happy,"So as the title implies, my favorite Pok�mon is Mareep, so here is why I love Mareep so much.

Back when Pok�mon Go was still relevant there was a Pok�mon go community day event where shiny Mareep was made more common in a certain time frame, and it just so happened to be on my birthday.

So me and my friend went to this Pok�mon Go sponsored park, and when people found out it was my birthday I got so many birthday wishes from everyone at the event and I hold that birthday close to my heart. So Mareep is a reminder of that very special day.",1
69,happy,"So when I was younger my school would give out three selections of milk (chocolate, vanilla and strawberry) I was really young (like 5 or 6) and so I would always get chocolate. Well one day they only had strawberry so I had to get that, I got my food and sat down. Me being the annoying kid I am, I began crying because I ""wanted the other milk"" eventually these kids who didn't know me or anyone else there walked over to me, sat down and told me it'll be alright, they had no clue I was crying about milk lmao-

So now anytime I'm sad I go out and buy some Strawberry milk.

To remind myself that some people are nice.

Some people care.

And it always makes me smile.",1

Tonight, he messaged that he was feeling really bad, and that he needed to see some cute things. So, I used my most efficient trick, and proceeded to show him all the emojis I could create with my keyboard ! We used to do that when he was sad. 

Now, he went to bed, feeling better but very tired.",1
71,happy,"hello i came here to tell a story about a guy i met to whom i will never forget

i was on a small field trip with one of my elective classes and we had about a half an hour to spare so we went to Starbucks. my friends and i got out stuff i got a brownie and a cake pop since i don't really like coffee (yes this is important to the story). I saw a person experiencing homelessness outside so I decided to go out and give him the money we had left over. He said thank you and i went back inside. I then thought ""I should get this guy's name"" idk why I just thought it would be a nice thing to do and my friends looked at me with a combination of that's so sweet and why tho. so I went out and ask him what his name was and he told me and I said my name and nice to meet you. He commented on my name and told me it was beautiful. I went back inside and thought for a moment. I myself have this nature to try and be kind to people of course i am not angel but i felt as though i could do more for him. So I grabbed my cake pop and took a piece of paper and wrote him a note. As we were leaving I gave him the note and cake pop. He just had this cheerful shocked look on his face that i couldn't help but smile. He called me sweet and took the cake pop and we left. The note basically said how to not loose hope because things will get better. I hope that Dylan is doing alright and hopefully he remembers me. Lesson of the day be kind to everyone because there really is no reason not to be.",1
72,happy,"Hey, so this is a pretty interesting and emotional story for me that my grandma has told me today. 
Trigger warning: Mention of suicide, suicidal thoughts, depression and dentists. 

My name is Robin and I'm 13 and suffer from depression/suicadial thoughts since about 2 years now. This is a story about how I kept my grandma alive instinctely. 

My depression has gotten worse the last 3 months, and I even was in a psychiatry. So now, I'm not allowed to stay at home by myself so I went to my grandparents. They don't live far away, so that's no problem. I had already spent most of the day there, with my grandparents and also my brother when he told me he's going home. He's 11 and we only live 1 block away so that's no big deal. He called my dad so he could open the gate (sounds a bit fancy but really isn't), and dad asked if I'm going too. 

It was around 7:30ish pm and it was already getting dark. My depressive thoughts are usually stronger in the evening, cause everything is getting dark and quiet and so I don't have any distractions (or at least not as much as there are in daytime) from my thoughts. Because I swore my therapist to tell somebody when I'm having bad thoughts I decided to stay. If I went home, I'd sit alone in my room and 'the thoughts' would have gotten stronger, so I would have had to tell someone, but my relationship isn't strong enough to tell my dad, so my grandparents are fine. And because of the fact that it was already getting dark, my grandma sent my granddad to come with my brother. 

So me and my grandma were alone and she noticed the thing in my eyes, you can only see when I'm depressed. It's when my eyes look so dark, that you think you can see my soul. Not everyone, nearly noone notices, but she did. So she started talking about the times she wanted to kill herself, not too long ago.

Background story: she fears the dentist. You could probably call it a phobia but it was worse. She wasn't at the dentist since she was around 20. She's 64. She often thought about taking an overdose to not having this pain, caused by her theet anymore. She never talked about this with anyone. She was ca. 50 years old when she couldn't find anymore reasons to live for, and lost all hope. I don't know if she had already started writing farewell letters to her family. Guess she did. 

But then, I was born. My mom is from Germany and my dad is from Nigeria and wasn't allowed to come to Germany at the date of my birth. He was in Austria while my mom was in the hospital. She needed someone to drive her, so my grandma did. She was 52 at that point. And there she was. Standing next to my mom's bed while she gave birth to me. 

She told me, that she immediately felt a connection between us. And she was right. 5 weeks after I was born, my dad finally showed up. He didn't have a job or was responsible of anything. So my mom didn't allow him to babysit me. He didn't care. So I ended up being with my grandmother everyday, cause my mom had to work. Immediately after my birth she had to start working again. I didn't care who was there for me, as long as I got food and a new diaper regularly. When I came, the suicide thoughts of my grandma didn't leave. But she finally found a reason to be alive.

For about 3 years she didn't have those bad thoughts. But then, when I turned 4 she was depressed again. I had gotten a brother, who was already 2 at the time, my mom didn't had to work that much because my dad found a job aswell, and I didn't have to spend that much time with my granny.

But I kinda sensed that my grandma wasn't doing so fine, cause I didn't leave her anymore, at least that's what my grandmother told me. So she had 'the thoughts' again, but just couldn't do it, because she knew, that I didn't love anyone nearly as much as her. And she stayed. For a long time everything was good, cause my grandma was too busy. Now she already had four grandchildren. More much work, less time to be depressed (I know this doesn't work with everyone, like me for example, but it helped her). 

But then 1 year ago she started feeling like shit because of her teeth again. Now she already has 7 grandchildren. And I was her favorite. But this time, I wasn't enough to keep her alive. She told herself:""You either fina-fucking-lly go to the dentist, or you'll kill yourself."" So she started researching. And she found it. She found a dentist for anxious patients. She couldn't even say the word 'dentist' without starting to shake. 

So she sent them an email and even told them about her suicidal thoughts, that the dentist had caused. But she did it. She went to the dentist, and told noone. At this point everyone knew, that she didn't go to the dentist for a long time. She never smiled, fearing she could show her teeth. She always spoke keeping her mouth mostly shut. She never encouraged any of her grandchildren to go the the dentist, when they were nervous because of him themselves. But the thing that broke her the most was the smiling. She had a reason not to smile, so it was harder for her to find a reason to smile, until it stopped completely. She went to the dentist. 

They had read her email carefully. I never knew that it was such a big deal to my grandmother until she told me today. After it was finally done, she called her children and told them. They told her that they were proud of her. I am too. She really never told this story anyone, especially not the suicidal thoughts part, except for me. Only because I was sad. I love her so much.

Thank you, grandma I don't feel worthless right now.",1

74,happy,"So there�s this kid at my school, and he has numerous times been bullied and he gets beat by his step dad. So this kid has always been �abnormal� and has done some weird stuff and has even made some threats to shoot up the school, and lately he�s been acting very aggressive and when he�s actually friendly people push him away and make fun of him. So I sit next to him and i here him �should I stay or should I go� and as a joke I started singing it with him and he was smiling and laughing, then the next day he�s sitting there and he asks if I play D&d and I said yes. So he gets all excited and went and talked about what he did in D&d for an hour and genuinely enjoyed himself, and this went on for a couple of days and he�s made weird remarks about �wanting to go to his uncles in Alaska cause he has a bunch of guns� and �you know there�s been only one school shooting in Alaska� which I can see what he was hinting at but I let him talk and then it was back to D&d, and over the course of the days he�s gradually stopped talking about shooting and has just been generally happier. And he�s actually a funny guy and a pretty good friend.",1

76,happy,"My older brother Matt has vowed to be like Mr. Rogers since he was a little kid and hasn�t stop for even a moment.

He runs tutoring groups and after school activities for the high school and middle school he works at so the kids have chances to get ahead or have a safe place to study/just be. Incase home is bad or they have no where to go. And In his classes he tries to do everything possible to help all students learn and be better from doing tests in different ways to making sure everything is covered in class so kids don�t have extra homework. 

Matt helped advocate for me with all the bad that�s happened to me and been my biggest supporter since I was born. He sends me uplifting memes and has a bunch of nicknames for me to replace all the hurtful ones our parents gave me. He let me live with him when I was kicked out and managed to get me into therapy. 

He tries to volunteer and raise money for good causes where ever and whenever he can. Matt wants everyone to feel good about life and believes more people should have reasons to smile during the day so he tries to be that reason. He�ll be the first to comfort people when they have a bad day and has been there for me on all my bad worse days reminding me that I was loved and deserving of life/happpiness.

78,happy,"I found a men�s class ring while metal detecting with my sons. The ring is from a local university and dated 1965 with initials engraved inside the band. 

I posted about this ring on a Facebook page dedicated to lost class rings around 7:00 AM in the morning. A member of the group researched the JCU yearbook to find his name and then used a people finder site to get a phone number and messaged me by 7:30. I waited till 8:00 to call. A gentleman answered the phone and I asked for him by name. 

�This is he�

�Hi, my name is Mike Gibson and this may sound a little weird, but I was out metal detecting with my boys this weekend around the Chagrin River and found a class ring...�

I heard a slight gasp.

�I remember exactly where I lost it, we were climbing the rocks along the river.�

I heard joy and disbelief in his voice. I then began to realize this was real. He went on to tell me he didn�t come from a rich family so the $80 he�d spent on the ring was a lot of money. He did not have the ring very long before losing it.

�It is something that I�ve regretted my whole life.�, he said. 

So much so that he bought a replacement ring about 10 years ago. 

Now I am beginning to realize the opportunity to help teach our kids an important life lesson that they will never forget. I ask him if he would mind coming to our house for dinner to get the ring and tell us his story, he agrees immediately.

�That would be great, I would love to meet your kids and tell them my story.�

So now we have set a date for dinner on Saturday, March 7th. 

�That�s the next time we will have all of our kids together, do you mind waiting until then?�

�I�ve waited 55 years, another week won�t kill me!�

80,happy,"My best friend's mom passed away when we were 10. Her service was held on Halloween. Our mutual friends went trick or treating for a half hour. Then went home and changed and walked together to the funeral home ( 5 blocks from my old house). Knowing full well she needed us there. Also knowing that Halloween was her favorite holiday. We hugged. We cried. We sat and waited until the end of the service. We went back up to *April and handed her every single piece of sugary loot we had gathered in that short time. Although most of us have went out separate ways since then, April and I remain besties. She still talks about that day. She says the only light she saw in the darkness was us. It came full circle 8 years ago when my dad died in a horrific explosion at work. Even though we hadn't really spoken for some time (estrangement due to drug abuse on her part) she was first in the line. She hugged me tighter than I have ever been hugged. She, like all our childhood friends some 30+ years before, took a seat, and waited. She came back to me, handed me an envelope and left in tears. The next day, I opened the envelope to find a young child's handwriting. Pages and pages of notes about her pain during her loss, and how her best friends' silent support was the only thing that carried her through. Sorry about the long story, but I hope this proves that the slightest notion during such heartbreaking times can serve to be the light someone so desperately needs to find.",1
81,happy,"

A bit of backstory before we begin: I have Dyspraxia, which I can best sum up as ""A appetizer sampler tray of developmental disorders,"" and this includes a few characteristics of Autism. I can get pretty easily overwhelmed at times, and so, around the time of this story, I would always bring a sketchbook with me to my high school to doodle in to calm me down.

Anyway, during this particular day, I woke up wayyy later than I should have (I usually get up at around 6:10, and on this particular day, I woke up at around 6:45), so I had to rush a bit to get to school. Take a shower, get some breakfast, get my backpack, but thankfully, I was able to get to school on time.
My first period starts. Math. Today we have to do a review on the unit we've been studying for a quiz. I'll just reach into my backpack and...

Wait-

Where's my pencil case?

Okay, I'll just reach into some of the outer pockets, and...

No pencils.

Wait... I usually keep my sketchbook and pencil case on my bed so I can get them in my backpack every morning, so if I forgot my pencil case-

*Oh No.*

I search in my backpack some more. *No sketchbook.*

Panic starts to set in. I'm able to borrow a pencil from the teacher to work on my review.
Before I start crying.
I usually have my hair (which is pretty long) down, so if I just look down at my review and focus, I can hide my crying. I'm also very good at staying quiet while crying. A few people notice me and ask if I'm alright, which I respond with the clich�d ""I'm fine,"" and people just go back to whatever they were focusing on. Soon the bell rings, and I quickly get my stuff and get out of the classroom.
Second period starts. English.
I get to class, and I put all of my stuff down to get ready for today; I get some tissues from the teacher's desk, and that's when she notices me crying. She asks me if I'm alright, which I respond with ""I'm fine."" She doesn't buy it, and she drags me out of the classroom.

""Alright, what's wrong?""

After a lot of stuttering and sobbing, I tell her a short summary of what happened. I always bring my sketchbook (and pencils) to school, I forgot them today, and my mom will be out of town for the entire day, so I can't ask her to bring me my sketchbook and pencil case. My teacher pats my back a bit, and tells me to go to the bathroom to calm down. So I do, I hang out in the bathroom for about five minutes, before I get back to class. I'm still a mess, but I look less like one.
But then I see it.

On my desk, there were five sheets of blank printer paper, and two regular pencils.

I never felt so relieved in my life, and my teacher was looking at me with a smile. Thankfully, I didn't really have to do anything that day for English. So what did I do?
I doodled.
And by the end of class, with the sheets of printer paper in hand as I left, I was back to normal.",1

84,happy,"Last night I got in an accident that totaled the car I have owned for 17 years. Fortunately, I was okay. It wasn�t a super high-speed collision, but I hit was an SVU with a high bumper that hit squarely into my hood. It didn�t need a lot of force to do a lot of damage.

I don�t usually anthropomorphize my possessions, but that car was an exception. It had a personality to me, it had a character, and it had a life.

My mom died when I was 19, and my dad got me the car only a few months later. I didn�t want my mom to pass, but she was also abusive, controlling, and codependent. In a lot of ways, getting that car represented a freedom I had never had before.

I knew we were perfect for each other the day I got it. My dad wanted to get me a low tier convertible, because he thought it looked cool, but I refused. I wanted something I could afford to maintain on my own, and I wanted to attract friends that were down to earth, ones that cared about me not my car.

I also insisted on a key fob, even though those weren�t standard yet. I have ADHD and had locked my keys in the hand me down truck I had driven in High School more times than I can remember. But, I knew if I needed the fob in my hand to lock the door, locking it in the keys in the car wasn�t something I had to worry about any more. I also insisted on a standard transmission. I wanted a car I could really get to know, to learn what it liked and didn�t like, and how to coax it into doing things even it didn�t think it could.

There was only one car on the entire lot that had both those features, and it was stored in the back of the lot behind a few dozen other cars. I made them move all of those cars, just so they could get that special one for me. It was even Silver, just like I wanted.

That car was there with me all through college, which I not only had to navigate on my own with learning disabilities, I also had to build all the social skills I had missed out on in high school because of mom. But I dove headfirst into all those challenges, and that car helped carry me through.

It was also there for almost every outing with my Little when I volunteered for Big Brothers Big Sisters, which has been one of the most enduring and important relationships in my life.

That car went with me when I drove all the way to California just to see Radiohead, and drove to Chattanooga and Indiana to visit friends about a year later. It saw me through two cross country moves, and came only about a hundred miles away from seeing both coasts with me.

But it also saw the bad.

When I was in an abusive relationship for 6 or 7 years, it was a safe haven. The only space I truly had to myself. During that time, it also saw the darkest moment of my life. My ex publicly humiliated me at fastfood restaurant. Then when we were confronted by the staff, because I was the one crying and visibly upset, she played it off as if I was the one abusing her. After she drove off that night, I got in my car and pointed it at a brick wall about 50 yards away. For only a second I floored the gas, just to see how it would feel. That moment horrified me, and I got help about a week later, though it still took years to accept that my ex was abusive and leave.

That car never judged me, and it never failed to be there when needed it.

When I finally got out of that relationship, and met my first boyfriend, that car carried us all the way to Washington DC for the first Women�s March. Later that year it carried us around Yellowstone, through Montana, and to Seattle in one the wildest and most amazing adventures of my life. I�ve lived in Seattle for around 3 years now, and I even bought a condo just a few months ago.

That car got me, and I got it. It was forgiving of the things I was bad at (like when I got a little container to be a trash can that sat right behind the passenger seat, but always let it overflow before taking it out). But I also didn't care when the interior handles for the back-seat doors started to come off if you pulled them too hard, and I made sure everything important was taken care of. When the driver side door started to creak, I gave it WD40, when the radio broke down, I just got a Bluetooth speaker to use with my phone, when the a rear door window wouldn�t stay up, because I couldn�t afford to replace the motor for it, I had the shop take the motor out and put in a makeshift part that just always held it closed.

I used to talk to it sometimes. Just little conversations every now and then. Whenever it broke down, I'd pat its dashboard and reassure it that it was okay, it would get fixed. And when I made the move to Seattle, I told it I knew it was getting old, that this wasn't going to be easy, but that I believed in it.

It took care of me, and I took care of it. 

At the accident last night. I was the first to get out my car, and check on the two other drivers. After that I looked back and saw how busted up it was. In so many ways, I�m at the best place in my life, and I finally feel truly safe for the first time. Staring at that car as it sat there in the rain with its hood totally caved in and radiator crushed, I realized it would never drive again. But this time instead of me talking to it, letting it know it would be okay, it stared back at me as if to say ""it's okay, you don't need me anymore. It's time to let me go""

I�m grateful I�m alive and no one was hurt in the accident. I�m also grateful that car carried me as far as it could. After the accident, everyone in my life has been supportive, but most don�t really get what that car actually meant me. I knew that car longer than the dog I grew up with, and almost as long as I knew my mother. Next year, I would have known it half my life. Its awkward, but while everyone around me is understandably focused on making sure I am okay, I feel like I�m mourning one of the oldest and best friends of my life. I know I will move forward, and it�s even fitting that that car came into my life when I needed it most and held on just long enough for me to get where I needed to be. But I will miss that car for the rest of my life.",1
85,happy,"So there is this boy at my school we will call him J. J was always so nice to everyone. He had a lot of energy and was always excited about his video games. J was deaf and that didnt stop him from expressing himself. It was difficult for him to play games because he couldnt have hearing cues to anything but he persevered because all he knew was quiet. He was able to hear very very low frequencies but that doesnt matter because nothing ever went as deep as he could hear. Anyways, he was very kind to me and would give up his seat for me constantly. One day he came into school looking happier then usual, which is hard for him to get to seeming how is always joyful. J was standing there and smiling. He would smile everytime I started talking another friend. It took me a while to relize but HE COULD HEAR. His family saved up money and bought him a hearing aid that costed 4000 dollars. He was so happy to be able to hear my voice. I cannot explain how happy it made me though. My friend could finally learn to talk and understand me.Then the drumline started to play and he got even happier! I think he is more happy because he can finally get to hear his games.",1

87,happy,"I've been using Simple for my banking since 2015 and when I woke up today I noticed an extra $20 in my account that I know wasn't deposited any time soon. I know what you might be thinking, free $20, but I panicked a bit since it wasn't really free $20 and I had to get to the bottom of this. I messaged the support team, I wish I could screencap it but since it's a banking app Android blocks screencaps. The message was as follows.

-[Initial Message]-
Topic: More Money in my account than I thought I had

I went to bed last night and swear I only had $2, but looking at my account today it said I have $22. I know it changed and I don't see any deposits that would have added the extra $20. I'd hate to spend money that doesn't belong to me even if it's tempting to get gas with so I just want to know if this is a mistake or if a payment was declined or a deposit took a while to process or something.
I really can't find anything myself that would make this add up and as I said I rather not spend money that isn't rightfully mine. If this was a mistake, please remove the surprise money since it's not mine. If it's not, at least tell me so I can calm down. I'd like an explanation if one can be provided but it's okay if I don't get one, confirmation is good enough.
-[End]-

So I left the house for a bit and on the drive back I got a message myself, and reading it made me smile. I'm gonna have to redact a few things but here it is.

-[Response]-
Awhhh, you are so kind and thoughtful that this message genuinely made me smile. 

So when I take a look it appears that the Steamgames.co ### transaction for $19.99 that was initiated February 6, 2020 was cancelled. 

Sometimes, merchants just take a while to finalize on transactions and the hold for the funds can fall off making it look like the funds have credited back into the account, but the merchant can reclaim those funds at a later date. I can't tell if this transaction is from the transaction being cancelled or the merchant taking time to finalize.

If you want to be certain you can reach out to the merchant to see if it was cancelled. If not, it's safe to assume they'll pull it at a later date. 

All the best,
[REP NAME]
-[End]-

TBH I was expecting a less human reply, and even if the bulk of the message may be a copy/paste quote from the bank's ""Tell customers this to calm them down"" list I really hope me being honest actually made the rep smile. If they appreciate me being honest to a fault, then I think it's not as much of a fault; at least this time.",1
88,happy,"I have a teacher who has gone above and beyond in her job, she teaches special education and since I have learning disabilities (I have PTSD and ADD which make it hard for me to pay attention in class a lot), I've had her as a teacher for a few years now. She's had my back when I needed it most as she did for all the students. We found out she had an aggressive cancer and that she had to go through chemotherapy. A local business said that for every kid that wore pink to school, they would donate a certain amount of money. When they announced the day, every other student gathered up as much pink as they could and brought it for those who own nothing pink. Ribbons, hats, etc. One kid even ordered cheap pink shirts in bulk. We managed to get every single student to wear something pink. And when she announced she was cancer free almost a year later, we threw a party for her with baked goods and foods we all brought in.
Granted, we're only a small school in a small town, and are a bit more close knit, but we have never had this level of organization in any event in our school. We've never until that point had a moment where every single student got together for one purpose. And it was a beautiful to see that sea of pink in the hallways.
Also one of the teachers shaved off her hair to join the teacher with cancer and support her, and one of the male staff dyed his hair pink to show support.

90,happy,"I still totally think this was a great revenge so I wanted to put this story somewhere! I�m excited and uplifted to have found this subreddit.







Alt/Throwaway account because it involves child abuse and I don�t want to get anyone in trouble for how they handled things.







I guess this is more my mom�s story than mine, but I was involved. It�s about how I got my sister. I�ll call myself Sara and my friend Alex.







Since middle school, I have been best friends with Alex. It all started with us being paired for a project, and we did great together! I struggled often in school, so my parents were so happy. So I invited her to eat lunch with my group of misfit friends. She was an outcast, too. From then on, she would help me with any schoolwork I needed, and I would help her with math. See, I wasn�t born in America, and my family immigrated during a critical period in my language development, so I needed anything and everything I wrote for classes proofread and edited. Don�t get me wrong, I�m pleased we moved for my mom�s career- she became basically Dr. Cuddy to our small town hospital and clinic- but that sort of move isn�t all roses.







Alex was great at improving my written work. Even my parents loved her, because they saw my grades go up as she helped me, and she was always respectful and quiet. A Good Influence.







We quickly became best friends, so much so that everyone at school tended to refer to us in one breath as �AlexandSara.� The only classes we ever had differently were AP English for her, regular for me, and our language classes. She took one and I took the other.







I still feel bad about not figuring out what was going on earlier. But Alex was the brainy one, not necessarily me. Sure, there were hints. I�m pretty sure it�s not normal for your friend to eat half your kitchen when she comes over, or my having to sneak her breakfast and other extras. But I just thought it was a weight thing. Alex�s mom was a rail thin athlete, who also thought it was important for her kids to be bilingual. It�s hard to know what�s going on when you don�t even know a dozen words of said difficult foreign language. And we hardly ever went to Alex�s house anyway.







Over a period of the first three years I knew her, Alex slowly changed. It was nearly unnoticeable unless you knew her as well as I did, but she went from talkative and happy to withdrawn and...crushed. I don�t know how else to describe it. It was like cutting off oxygen to a fire. Her flame suffocated. She didn�t want to go swimming or play sports any more, wore jeans and long sleeves no matter the weather, and seemed perpetually exhausted. Toward the end, I swear she was losing weight, and was as white as notebook paper. Another funny thing was that she *never* cried.






I, I mean we, *tried*. But every time, Alex would insist everything was fine, no matter who or how asked her. Eventually I dropped the subject. I could tell she was getting annoyed with me.






One late winter day, it was weirdly warm. It�s cold where we lived then, so of course we went for a walk. The sunset bathed everything in red. We were out so long that it was nearly dark when we stumbled back.






Alex tripped or something. Partially melted ice is the worst, and it was right at the foot of the neighbors� gravel driveway. Before I got there, she was already staggering to her feet again, so it can�t have been that bad.






�I just cleaned, so take off your shoes at- Alex, you�re bleeding,� my mom called, abruptly switching tack mid sentence, as we dragged mud inside.






�I�m okay. I just fell down in some gravel.� But one knee looked ruined, and there was a big scrape just above her elbow, already bleeding through the shirt.






�Let me-� mom insisted.






�*No!* I mean, no thank you.�






I caught a note of panic in Alex�s voice. Alex never panicked. Why now, over something so minor?






�Don�t be stupid. You might have some pieces of gravel embedded where you fell.� Alex flinched at the use of �stupid,� but she was four foot eleven and a hundred pounds if that at the time. No contest. My family�s unusually tall. It wasn�t hard for my mom and I to steer her, limping badly, into the kitchen.






I knew the routine from my mom treating a million childhood bumps and bruises, and went to get the massive first aid kit from the bathroom.







�Alex, hold still so I can-� Then thirty seconds of the loudest silence I ever heard, just broken by the tap running, greeted me as I came back in.







�Sara, put it on the table. Alex, *breathe*. You�re panicking,� my mom finally said. Then I saw what made my friend finally lose her cool.







The parts of her arm not scraped raw were covered in a web of scars, some old, some fresh.






�Why didn�t you tell me?� I blurted out.







My mom told me sharply in our language to be quiet if I couldn�t help, told Alex it was okay, she wasn�t mad, we�ll discuss this after we finish patching you up. There were more scars on Alex�s legs, too.






Eventually, with lots of stopping and starting because she was crying so hard, we found out that Alex had been hurting herself for almost three years. She was always anxious. Everything had to be perfect for her mom. Even admitted, in a roundabout way, that said mom told her really cruel things, called her names, and didn�t like to give her enough to eat. Think Amy Chua with a food complex.







And of course, my mom had to tell her, hey, I�m going to tell whichever of your parents comes to pick you up tomorrow about this. So you can get help. �Better you than me. They�ll kill- I mean, be so angry then,� Alex, looking resigned, said.







I woke up to a raging argument the next morning. Couldn�t be my dad or brother- dad was abroad, brother already in college. No, this was a catfight. I went over to where Alex was sleeping and covered her ears. This was nasty. I told her she really didn�t want to hear it. But I didn�t have four hands, so I heard it all. I recognized her mom�s voice. No, I won�t get her any help, she�s lying. Just being dramatic. Don�t listen to her. Don�t tell me how to parent.







Finally, my mom asked point-blank whether Alex�s mom would be pursuing any kind of treatment for her kid. Mommy Dearest said no, I get to choose medical care for my own kid, she�s only sixteen.






What happened next would have knocked me over if I hadn�t already been sitting down. I strained my ears and just caught, �...you�re right. It is your choice. But, I�m a mandated reporter due to my job, and you�ve just admitted you�re going to neglect your child�s serious medical problem. I put a tape recorder somewhere for this talk in case things got ugly. It would be a shame if someone reported you to CPS with evidence, you being a teacher and community figure��







I jumped about eight feet in the air when Alex�s mom yelled back, �Are you *threatening* me?�







�Not at all, Mrs. X,� my mom said calmly. �What I�m saying is that if *you* don�t help Alex, *I* will. My family has grown to love her and we don�t want anything to happen. I have a form here that would allow me to make medical decisions for her, just temporarily. Sign it, leave her with us, and I won�t report you to CPS.�







There was more arguing, but my mom had clearly shifted the balance of power her way. I don�t know exactly how she did it, but she got the signature, and we kept Alex. I was so happy to finally, really get a sister, whatever the circumstances. And my dad? He had been abroad for a few weeks at that time. I can�t imagine *that* conversation! Like, �I saw a stray human, can we keep her?�







And Alex got better. I mean, at first there were a lot of arguments. It was like pulling the pin on a grenade. Once she couldn�t cut, Alex had no idea how to handle herself! I mean, she barely slept! I was sure she was going to get the boot- if I�d said those things-, but my mom is my hero, and the calmest person I know. Then I had a huge shock- my perpetually strong friend cried for weeks on end. Well, at least it wasn�t cursing or yelling.






After things were a little calmer (which took a few months), my parents, Alex�s parents, a mediator, and Alex�s stockbroker uncle all sat down together. See, Alex�s uncle had an education fund he was tending for her, and he was appalled to learn of his sister in law�s conduct.






By then, she was seventeen. It wasn�t too hard to pull the funds a year early and use them to pay for Alex�s portion of the family insurance premium, since they were furious about continuing to pay it. In return, her parents signed a temporary guardianship form. This extended my mom�s authority past medical decisions- it�s essentially the same form that lets host families of exchange students act as parents- into all major aspects, and let her sign forms as Alex�s guardian, so she could go on field trips again. There was even enough money, if she was careful, to put Alex through all of college and provide her with a small personal allowance until she graduated. Not that my parents couldn�t afford another person, but Alex was big on not being a burden.






My parents and I moved when I was 22, and even though it�s far away, Alex knows she can visit whenever she wants. Seeing her smiling and playing with my one year old son is really what made me think to write this story here. It�s not a perfect mean or funny revenge like many I see here. 





But my revenge is having my �sister� here. Alive. She still has some problems, and can�t work full time at the moment, but has a supportive spouse, a decent part time job, and volunteers at an animal rescue.

91,happy,"Niko, a man experiencing homelessness, approached me outside of union station in denver asking for help. I almost ignored him because I was wearing headphones, but I decided to give him my attention. He said he just got out of the hospital this morning, because he'd been hit by a car, asked me if I know where the bus to Colorado springs leaves from.
I had an hour to spare before my appointment
so I bought him a warm breakfast, and I listened to his story as we ate together.
Found out he's trying to get to texas, 
back to his mom. 
Found out he was a catholic, 
so we talked about jesus, 
even though I'm not a christian,
and we talked about the kindness of strangers, 
and about how money doesnt buy happiness if your heart is closed to looking at the basic human decency of other human beings.

I bought him a cell phone charger and a bus ticket, and gave him 50 dollars cash,
The least I could do to help a good man get back on his feet (he was limping from having been hit by that car).

We talked about how the world can be so openly cynical towards manifesting acts of kindness, yet so morbidly accepting about public displays of hatred, or so numb & indifferent towards hitting someone with their car. We talked about how resistant most people can be about supporting one another, and how most people would rather attack each other, critique or condemn or hide from each other.

We talked about can change in a single moment, bad to good or good to bad, like lightning, and about worshipping false idols like money, or false spiritualities. 

I told him I was once down on my luck too, 
And I told him he was righteous, and told him that Jesus would help him get home to his mom, if he just opens his heart to jesus,!because he is a righteous dude who just had some bad luck, and needed a little help, like we all do sometimes",1

93,happy,"I've always struggled with mental health.

Ever since I was 7 there was something different about me mentally. Aside from having schizophrenia, I also have major depression and anxiety. I'm transgender, bipolar and I've been struggling with self image for years. 

When I was younger I always had to take care of my mom. She has diabetes and would always need around the clock care. I would come home at 10 years old, change her iv bag and then stay with her until dad got home. Every weekend she would go to the hospital and need emergency help because she couldn't breathe well or she was in immense pain. Life was tough for her and for me. When dad would get home, he would go right to helping her and I was left all alone. I had no siblings, I'm adopted and I never really felt like I was apart of the family. 

Fast forward to about grade 4. Mom got surgery, they removed a giant tumor from her stomach. She vowed to never let her life get so bad again and told me herself, that she was never going to take shit from anyone else ever again. I was so excited for her, she finally did it and was ready to take on the world. I though I finally had my mother back. I was so happy. But then she started going to school. She left me behind and began studying every weekend. I wouldn't see her for weeks or months at a time, she would come home late and would leave before I even woke up. 

Dad was always doing work related things so I wouldn't see him at all until around 19:00 when he would come home, take off his belt and sit on the couch until 22:00 at which point he would go upstairs and pass out on his bed. I wouldn't see him until the next day, when he did the same thing. It was rough for him, having to pay off all the debts from medical care, on top of not having his wife at home to say hello to him. It was tough. 

At this point, my mental health got worse. They had to pull me out of a school I really enjoyed and had all my friends. I was miserable, being at a school with people I didn't know. Constantly being bullied day in and day out. It was terrible, especially feeling not with the boys because I was trans, but not being liked by the girls since I had a boys body. Life was awful. I went to a psychiatrist with my dad. He told me that I was suffering from many things, and that the fact that I wasn't taking medication for it was ridiculous. He put me on a bunch of medications. Now it was even harder to pay these things off.

At this point, I was dying emotionally, hoping that anyone would just help me be happy. Constantly looking at pictures from around the house of when I wasn't miserable and hoping that I would die. 

Skipping forward years, I was in grade 8. Still struggling with mental health. Still wanting to die. At this point I had already been admitted into a mental institution twice, still getting bullied, mom was still gone, dad was still working. I graduated middle school. Never had a single break, was constantly taking classes throughout summer. Went into college at 16.

I dropped a semester due to constant panic attacks, major depression episodes, and constant hallucinations. Admitted myself into an outpatient group therapy program. I hated it at first. I thought I was never going to fit in with these people. Then someone came up to me and introduced me to everyone. 

I was in that program for 3 months. Not much considering I was in therapy since I was 7. But it helped me once I finally gave in and asked for help.

I graduated last Monday. Though I'm still struggling to work out my emotions. I made friends who are there for me and can talk about my past trauma of sexual assault and just simply dealing with my emotions. I'm not entirely happy yet, but I can say for a fact that I'm getting there. And now I have friends who can help guide my path. I feel refreshed and finally, I don't want to die.",1
94,happy,"My daughters came to live with us in late November 2004 from a crappy foster care situation and living in a van with their drug addled prostitute biological mom before that. Things were still very new to them. They were still adjusting to their new home and were amazed at the simple things like eating, playing with toys that belonged to them and having nice clothes to wear.

When the Christmas tree went up, they didn't have any idea what it was. They thought it was pretty and enjoyed decorating it and looking at it but other that... no clue.

When we talked about Santa they were clueless about that as well. They couldn't believe such a thing was possible. They were four and five years old at this point and had never experienced a Christmas of any consequence.

We took them to the nice mall for a visit to Santa. They asked, ""dad... that man really brings us presents?"" Of course, I explained and told them the whole deal.

I was really bothered by the fact that they came from a foster home and never got a single present, a tree or any of the traditions associated with it. When we picked up the girls from the foster home, the foster mom didn't give us anything except a bag of mens tube socks...no toys, dolls, nothing.

Gradually stacks of presents gathered under the tree, and on Christmas eve we put out milk and cookies for Santa.

They were very skeptical about the whole deal and were questioning the whole down the chimney thing and trying to find holes in my story.

We were listening to Christmas music and reading stories and they kept running to the front window.

I thought they were looking for Santa. Finally, I said, ""Santa won't come till later after you are asleep.""

The girls said, ""no dad we are looking for the police mans they always come get us at Christmas""

Sad.

Anyway, when the girls went to sleep I put on my big work boots stomped them around in the fireplace and left dirty boot prints on the white carpet leading to the cookies, took a bite, drank some milk, put out the Santa presents and went to sleep.

The next morning about 8AM I heard a tremendous squealing and laughing.

They dragged me downstairs to show me the footprints and the half eaten cookie. He's real! he's real!!!

They didn't care about the presents at all. They were caught up in the magic and that was fine with me.",1

I went into a dollar store one day after work just to buy junk food. I love doing that cause you usually get way more there than you would elsewhere.

At any rate, the candy section is near the cash desk and as I'm picking out my several poisons, I hear a customer being a d-bag to the cashier. I hate it when people do that. Been in customer service for years and I know how it is. You are basically defenseless for the most part when someone decided to mistreat you.

I finish picking out my junk including a strange item, a coconut key lime, two piece chocolate.

I get up to the counter and smile at the cashier. She didn't look happy. I changed that in the following manner.

Me: Hey when did you get these? (hold up the key lime coconut thingy)

Cashier: Very recently I haven't tried them. I'd like to though.

(She lightens up a bit.)

Me: Could you please leave them out of the bag? I'd like to try them right away. Thank you. (purposely being extra pleasant and polite)

She does as I asked and finishes ringing up my junk. I pay and then I do what she obviously didn't expect.

I pick up the key lime coconut thingy, open it up and offer the first piece to her. I take the second piece and we both bite in at the same time.

Me: Pretty good eh!

Cashier: (smiling) Yeah! I gotta get some before I leave work today.

Me: I sure would! You have a great day eh? (Yeah I'm Canadian)

Cashier: Thank you! You too.

I LOVE turning someone's day around like that. Remember, treat your customer service person...ya know...like a person. They take way more crap than most people!",1

One day I was there doing my thing, hanging out in the sun and chatting with random awesome people and selling stuff to some of them when this little kid comes up and goes for the toys.

I had a ton of Hot Wheels there for $1 each or buy 5 get 1 free... but I digress.

I see no sign of parents so I ask him ""Where's mom?"" and he tells me as he points in a vague direction, ""Over there."" and he continues looking at the cars. 

Now this kid couldn't have been more than 5 or 6 years old and he was alone at a big market. I'm scared for this kid and, honestly, pissed off at his mom for not taking better care of him. 

I'm about to call one of the flea market staff over when a girl shows up and gets the kid. She couldn't have been more than 11 or 12 so not much better. 

I figure that's that, big sis came and got him and I go back to doing my thing. 

Not ten minutes later the kid is back and straight over to the cars. I start talking to him asking which car he likes best cause I figure at this point he is safer with me than he is wandering around the place. I know I'm going to keep him safe cause, well, I know me. 

So I tell him, ""Hey, take any car you like. Pick one."" He looks up at me with the biggest smile and widest eyes.

""Really?"" he can't believe it!

""Yep!"" I tell him and we continue to talk about the best car to play with. He finally picks one and his mom shows up with big sis. 

He runs up to her all excited with his free car. She barely acknowledges him, doesn't even look in my direction. Piece of work...grrrrrrrr!

Big sis runs over and says thanks and the little guy smiles and waves as they vanish never to be seen by me again. 

By now that kid is likely in his teens...if I have my timeline right. I hope his life is better than I saw that day. I hope my small action sits with him and he pays it forward. 

I miss my booth, I miss my interactions, I miss my opportunities to bless. It was an awesome time of my life.",1
97,happy,"7 or 8 years ago I saw a cute puppy sticking his head out of a house's fence. He looked really excited and playful, me and my friend petted him for a bit and I took a picture of him. 

Today I was taking the usual road to go home when I saw this dog, beautiful and quite big. He came up to me, I petted him and recognized a white spot on the top of his head. It was that puppy ! 

I'm sure it's the same dog because I saw him not even 5 meter away from the house I saw him in as a puppy, plus that mark on his head and the color of his hair are quite recognizable, also I had never seen another dog like that in the neighborhood. 

It made me happy to see that puppy from 7-8 years ago all grown up.
I hope you find this wholesome and have a nice day. :)",1

Today me and my best (and only) friend have realized the reason I was feeling down recently.

Aside from many personal reasons that would just be making me sad, the way I was feeling recently could only be described as emptiness.

Turned out, he wouldn't let me worry about him, wouldn't let me make him feel better, stopped opening up and stopped telling me what was wrong. All that because he thought it would be a burden to me.

Honestly I felt something changed and I didn't know how to talk to him when I couldn't care and worry about him.

99,happy,"I have to tell this story anywhere I can because I love it so much. 

All last month I looked through all of my stuff to see if I could find anything that I would want to get rid of and I found my husband�s childhood N64 with our games, including my Gold/Holographic Majora�s Mask that my mom�s ex-fiance gave to me and my little brother before leaving our lives.

I already have the Collector�s Edition and my husband has the 3DS version so I was going to try to sell it� But I couldn�t. I loved that man almost as much as I love my own dad. I couldn�t sell it for extra AMKE money.

My little brother also has the Collector�s Edition, but he was having financial problems. I figured that I could give it to him and he could do whatever he wanted with it. I included the game in his Christmas presents and we had this conversation:

Him: �Oh sweet! I already have this game but it�s really cool to have the Gold Cart/Holographic edition!� 


Me:��I know. I�m giving it to you in case you need extra money. I couldn�t bring myself to sell it. It means a lot to me but I�ll be happier if you can get some use from it.� (Husband�s N64 doesn�t have the expansion pak. Also I was trying to get rid of things anyway.)

Him:��Wait, was it (husband�s)?�

Me:��No� It was the one given to us by (mom�s ex-fiance.)�

Him:��Wait what really?! Well I can�t sell it *now*! I�m going to have this thing on display!�

For the record, my mom only broke up with her ex-fiance because she decided that he deserves to raise his own child. One that she wasn�t willing to give him because she�s already a mother of two. Not for anything bad.

And a couple years ago I was able to find him after almost twenty years later. Funnily enough, I was able to spot him because of the Zelda shirt he was wearing, and my eyes have a special ability to lock onto Zelda anything. (He�s the one who got me into the series.) He was at the movie theater with his own flesh and blood son who was about five or six. He�s getting his son into Ocarina Of Time the same way he got me and my brother into it. I told him about how my brother, my mom and I are doing, introduced him to my husband (then fiance) and he then said something like

�I would wonder about how you guys are doing sometimes. Now I don�t have to.� 


After twenty years I still love him. Some of my favorite childhood memories involves him, and I�m really happy that he was able to have his own child, making the same memories with him as he did with us. (And more, obviously.)",1

102,happy,"Recently my dad was hospitalised for a nasty bike injury. Because we were on holiday when it happened, he was at a hospital five hours away while we had to go home before school started. He had an operation to put screws in his hip, went through very painful physiotherapy, and still can barely move even with crutches. Every day at the hospital, they gave him a packet of biscuits between lunch and dinner.

Last night he finally got home. One of the first things he did was open the bag of clothes we left with him before we left. He took out all the biscuit packets he'd been given and shared them out between me and my siblings.

He hadn't eaten a single one. He saved them all for us.

Okay, so I was worn out earlier at work.

There was a kid (about 10?) that came up to the front desk to see about renewing and replacing her library card. She usually goes there with her grandfather (You have to have a parent/guardian with you to get a card if you're under 18), but unfortunately, he passed away. We asked if she had anyone with her, and she said she was with her grandmother, but she had a leg problem, so she couldn't come to the front desk. (The entrance leads you to the children's room, and there's a ramp you have to take to go to the front circulation desk along with the main library) I offered to go down stairs and renew the card (You typically HAVE to do it upstairs, but the supervisor made an exception), so that her grandmother wouldn't have to struggle with going upstairs. So I get her card renewed, and the grandmother asked to see her husband's account if we hadn't cancelled it. There was a 5$ fine on there. She was about to pay it, but I was like ""You know what? Keep the 5, I'll forgive the fines. They were late books, and we have them, so what's the harm?"" 

Keep in mind, we have to keep you on file with a card that you fill out. It's upstairs, so as I'm going to renew the cards, I had to run up and downstairs two or three times. But I'd rather be tired for a few minutes than have these people have a rough day.

104,happy,"For those who haven't read [my last Christmas post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomestories/comments/edapfq/getting_my_sister_something_she_really_wanted_for/), quick recap; in 2018, I bought my sister, who hasn't played real video games in ages, an old game I used to play as a kid and that she would watch me play for hours on end.

In that, I mentioned that my husband had something similar planned this year (2019), so, little late, but here we go.



So two years after the Nintendo Switch released into the world and became like, one of the most popular handheld gaming systems of the century next to the Gameboy, Nintendo came out with an updated version. Spec-wise, the thing was perfectly identical, except for one thing that virtually everyone had been clamoring for; a longer battery life.

Our local game shop ran this campaign (likely with approval of the big guys themselves) to take in people's old Switches and exchange them with the new versions for an upcharge fee of 70 euros. The condition for this, though, was that the Switch couldn't be damaged in any way. My Switch was fine to be traded in, but my husband's had this one (barely noticeable) scratch across the screen. It wasn't bad, really, but if you paid attention, you'd notice it.

Still, he needed a Switch for work, AND he often traveled long distances for work, so it'd be beneficial for him to get the upgrade. So, he shelled out the extra 300 euros to get himself a brand new Switch. Which left the question; what to do with the old one?

See where this is going?

Initially, the plan was to sell the old Switch to someone (maybe my mom), but when Christmas was closing in, suddenly my husband had the brilliant idea to give it to my sister for Christmas.

I was fine with that. I mean, it was his system, still, so he could do what he wanted with it. Hell, I even threw in my copy of Mario Party (didn't play it as often after the first few weeks), so she'd at least have one game to play on it. However, I was still a bit unsure about whether there'd even be games on it for her that she'd like.

That is, until all three of us headed out to our game shop and got to discussing games. Where we (subtly) brought up the subject of her potentially getting a Switch.

Sis: I dunno... I mean, I got BotW for Wii U, and I wasn't able to finish that game cuz it was too hard...

Now remember; she's not a hardcore gamer anymore, so it makes sense that she would be overwhelmed by BotW, and we told her as much.

H: If BotW is too hard for you, maybe you should try Link's Awakening.

Sis: Hmhmm... Oh! I like the look of this game! \*picks up Splatoon 2\*

Me: Oh... that's mostly a multiplayer game, though...

Sis: Oh... never mind then. \*puts the case back\*

After a bit more back and forth and scouring the shelves, we asked her that, if she could pick any Pokemon game to get for Switch, which would she take. Took her a bit, but she eventually decided on Sword. Which might be an idea for her for when the new DLC drops...

Anyway, after ensuring she won't buy the Switch with her own money, we head home, now more than happy with the decision to give it to her later.

Come Christmas time, and a few presents left and right, it's finally time\~

She worked on the package slowly, slipping a finger under the paper to undo the tape, and began tearing off a section to the side... revealing a bright right box with a joy-con plastered on top of it, giving her pause.

Sis: \*visibly gobsmacked as she pulled the Switch case out\* You're kidding...!

Me & H: Nope!

Me: No, we're not kidding!

H: Open the box and see what's inside. There's something else there.

That worried her, of course, as she slowly opened it, almost afraid that there wasn't anything in there at all. Even after she lifted up the top and saw that, yes, the Switch was *definitely* in there, she wasn't sure, yet.

Sis: I'm afraid...

H: It's under the Switch.

Sis: I know, but I'm still afraid... \*lifts up the Switch\* MARIO PARTY!! :D \*grinning from ear to ear\* That's cool! Thank you!

109,happy,"Hello, this is my first time posting on reddit ever and it's a pretty short story. I will start this off by saying this happened about last year. I was 13, I'm 14 now and I'm still very happy and really appreciate what this lady did to help me even though it wasn't much. If she ever remembers this and manages to find and read this, Thank you! 
So, this happened during the summer. Near the end, I believe. I was getting ready to leave Dominican Republic so I can head back home here, in America. I ended up being late and missing my flight, unfortunately and had to wait another day before I had to leave. The next day, I took my first plane and landed on Miami because I was taking a connected flight back to Pennsylvania but apparently they hadn't secured a seat for me so I can head back home and I was a little nervous but thought ""It's no problem, they'll get me a seat in no time."" I was wrong. Plane after Plane with no luck. After my 4th plane I started to cry because I was scared I wasn't going to make it back. I cried and cried for a few minutes before this nice, light skinned lady came up to me. She was skinny and I think she had a buzz cut, if I remember correctly. 
When she came up to me she said ""I'm not going to ask if you're okay because you're clearly not okay, what's wrong?"" Or something along those lines and through tears and a little bit of snot I explained the whole situation to her and my fear of getting stuck since I had no one. She stood with me while my flight attendant was trying to get me a seat and calmed me down a little and my Flight attendant came back, I think we had no luck after that one and I was once again back in the waiting room. 
This was about a year ago and my memory is a little foggy but I still felt like I should share this story so people know that there are others who care about you, even if they don't know you! Some people just don't seem to know that.

I think she could have sensed how sad I was, but she was like I got you fam.

I love my cat Georgie so much, I�ll post a pic of her.",1
111,happy,"Old story, but since my husband is pulling a similar stunt this year as I did last year,

Background; I�m a gamer at heart, and have been since the very first Pok�mon game released. I got Pok�mon Red and my younger sister got Pok�mon Blue. We didn�t get a link cable initially, as we had to share my dad�s Gameboy to play, but we were happy with them nonetheless. We continued playing Pok�mon as we grew older, but my sister drifted away from gaming around Gen 3 and began to focus on other things.

Now, I didn�t play Pok�mon exclusively. When I was at home, I would sit down in the living room, hook up our Playstation (the original) and play Chrono Cross. My sister would sometimes sit down and watch me play the game, sometimes for hours on end, commenting on everything I did in game and sometimes roleplaying as the characters with me when I did something dumb or silly.

Before continuing, quick note; the original Playstation was region-locked (yeah, I know, dumb), but could be modded to play games from other region and� wait for it� pirated games. This was during a time when it was still hip and cool. Rest assured, I�ve grown over that.

When I moved out of my parents� house with my then-boyfriend-now-husband, I left most of the games that we had at my parents� house for my sister to enjoy� but I forgot to leave behind a memory card. Whoops.

Anyway, my sister didn�t play on it much, because it was too much of a hassle for her to set it up. When she finally moved out, though, she had the space to set it up and began playing games on it on occasion (mostly Crash Bandicoot 2 and 3).

Now the main story;

Last year, somewhere mid-May, I believe, we were all at my parents� house for dinner, when she asked me a question.

Sis: Hey, do you still have Chrono Cross?

Me: Yeah, I do. �Why?

Now, Chrono Cross was one of the few games I had opted to take with me for two reasons.

1) it was still one of my favorite games of all time for the PS1

2) I had actually bought it officially after the pirated version we had got scratched to the point where it was no longer playable.

Sis: Well, can I borrow it?

Me: Wait� you wanna play it?

Sis: Yeah.

Me: Why? I mean, you can borrow it, sure, but why so suddenly?

Sis: Well, I took the Playstation to my apartment and as I was playing I thought �Hey, I�ve never actually *played* Chrono Cross. I�ve only ever watched you play it.

Me: Oh yeah, you did.

Sis: Oh! And can I also borrow your memory card? I think you took it with you.

Me: Did I not leave any? Ah, my bad. Yeah, I�ll look for them so you can borrow them.

However, when I got home afterward, I had a MUCH better idea.

I went online, and found (and bought) her an actual copy of Chrono Cross plus a memory card, to gift her for Christmas. And not just a second-hand copy; no, I got her a *brand new* copy of it. So new, that the Squaresoft logo was replaced with that of Square Enix.

She did ask every so often if I�d found the game and card yet, and I would say I hadn�t, but I�d try to find it ASAP. 

Finally, Christmas arrived, and we�re at my parents� house. I, as usual, am handing out the presents to everyone. After a few presents between the rest of my family and husband, I gave my sister her present. Now I�d wrapped them both up in one package, with the memory card obscuring the cover of the game, so you�d see that first and would have to pull it away to see the rest.

As she pulled away the wrapping, you could see the confusion on her face as she read out loud, before shifting to realization.

Sis: Playstation� ooooh! Memory cards! Awesome!

And then she removed it from the game case.

The second she realized what she was looking at, she gasped and � no joke � she squealed, and I laughed as she excitedly showed it off to everyone.

Me: Now you don�t have to borrow it; now you have your own copy.

I know the general rule of thumb not to give a homeless person money, just in case he uses it to buy himself drugs or alcohol, and I don't carry any money with me anyway because I find it easier using my debit card. I went ahead with my business, buying myself the stuff I need/want to last me the fortnight until my next trip to the shops. Since it is almost Summer, and the recent Spring days have been really darn hot, I decided I'd buy the homeless guy a bottle of water. I grabbed a 1.75 litre bottle of spring water and bought it alongside the rest of my things.I went to the place where I saw the homeless guy and noticed the stool he was sitting on was vacant. The dude was nowhere to be seen, but then I didn't get a good look at him on my way in anyway. I looked around briefly to see if I could find him (I couldn't) and decided I'd leave the water on the stool, he'll probably take it when he gets back.Soon as I put the bottle of water on his stool, I heard him call out to me from a few metres away. He gave me a wave and said ""thanks buddy"". I'm usually a quiet person so I smiled, gave him a thumbs up, and walked away.

The moral of the story, my friends, is that homeless people are still human. If you see one on the street, please help them. Give them food, water, clothes, anything you can spare for them or are willing to buy for them. You'll never know just how much they need a kind gesture.",1
123,happy,"So, my whole life I've had breathing problems. Today at school I had very short breaths and my teacher noticed. He asked if I was alright because the same happens when I have an anxiety attacks. I nodded and explained that my lungs were being a butt. He nodded and went into his small fridge he keeps in his room and gave me a thing of mochi. I love mochi so much and no one said anything about it being unfair. For some reason having something soft like ice cream helps me breathe better after a bit. My english teacher really did that.",1

Unfortunately the little bunny died before that. We decided to leave him in the box and bury him the next day. Fast forward to the next morning and I met the school caretaker, who informed me that he had dumped the dead rabbit in the bin. So I went outside and found a rock, put it in the box and taped the box up securely. When the kids came in they wrote some poems and drew some pictures of the rabbit, then went outside, dug a hole, made a cross from some sticks, had a funeral and buried the rock.",1

128,happy,"Okay so I grew up with basically just me and my older brother. Our mom was addicted to drugs and our Dad M.I.A until I was like 7 but then died of an overdose before I turned 8. We were sent to live with our grandparents who were major dicks and would constantly put me down and get mad at ME when my brother stood up for me. He was honestly like a real G. But then when I was 15 he died, someone hit him with a car. It was an accident and I try not to hold it against them because ik it was an accident (still hard though). Anyways all that to say I've never really had family besides my brother, none that felt like it anyhow. Well after he died I moved in with my Great Aunt in a different state and was welcomed into the family with open arms. My brother and I would visit in the summer and they were some of my happiest memories but we were too far to have a real family connection if that makes sense (I mean it was real but it's not the same ig). In moving here I've felt so much love my family that I literally cry sometimes out of happiness. For 15 years I've only cried out of sadness and in these last two years I've cried of joy so many times I cant even keep count. I have so many cousins here of all varying ages, and they're so amazing. Literally just their desire to hangout with me means the literal world to me and everytime they do things that show me they love me I just wanna cry. For the first time in my life I feel like I have parents that care about me, I finally get to experience what it's like to have a real mother, and it's such an amazing thing to have. My uncle talks to me like a daughter and dead ass I can honestly say that all my weird mommy/daddy issues are gone. Ik that's weird but I used to joke about it and now I feel like I CANT. One of my cousins has become like my older sister and we hangout almost every weekend. Shes helped me build my confidence up so much and realize that I DESERVE respect, and I deserve more than what I had. She recently changed my contact name to sister and I didnt say anything but I cant express how happy that made me. My other cousin always wants to hangout with me and she had a childhood similar to mine so I get to have that connection and understanding that I had with my brother over shared traumas (again weird thing to say but it's nice to have someone who truly understands). Theres so many more people that have become my family that I could write a whole book. I literally love them all with all my heart, and although nothing can replace the relationship I had with my brother, they have helped me heal from losing him and have brought joy in my life that I didn't know was possible to feel. As someone who spent the first 15 and a half years crying myself to sleep and contemplating suicide on a weekly/daily basis, to feel this level of love and joy at 17 seems surreal. I'm happy. I cant express to them the pure love I have for them because I dont know how to without seeming weird. And they all grew up with eachother, with that family connection, it might be weird because I didnt so everything I feel is so new and strong. Plus due to past stuff I have a hard time expressing my emotions to people but I just really needed an outlet to share how much I love them. They are such beautiful people, they are what brought joy back into my world and I can never thank them enough for it. I went from having a train wreck of a life to an almost perfect one, the only thing that would make it better is if my brother were here and got to experience it too, but I know hes happy knowing I'm not alone, knowing that I'm finally happy.",1
129,happy,"Tw: self harm, suicidal thoughts, suicide.


This starts off a bit sad, but it gets better I swear. So just bear with me through the sad bit.


Back in college I was in a very bad place. Eventually it came to a head in February, becoming too much to bear, and I attempted suicide. After going to the hospital and returning back to my residence room for weeks I felt worse and worse.I described it as an emotional hangover, like as if I thought it would just pass. Before hand I had struggled with self harm. But after it just got worse. At one point my arms were covered in injuries. Naturally when I went out I wore long sleeves. So when I went to my practical lab (it was like a functional spa, I was in an esthetician course) I wore a cardigan over my uniform. I was booked to do a pedicure that day. That meant rolling up my sleeves. Obviously I had an issue with that. I mustered up the courage to ask my teacher if she had gauze and medical tape. I said I had some injuries that I wanted to protect when doing the pedicure service. She said she did and insisted on bandaging them for me. I let her. When she saw the damage her face dropped. I broke and told her what I had been got through. She continued to bandage me and tell me how getting to know me through the semester had been a pleasure, she had grown to like me, thought I was important, needed, talented, and special. She said so many nice and encouraging things to me in that small storage room. At that point I had been so alone, felt so worthless and invisible. For the first time in awhile I felt noticed and understood. I cried for the first time in front of another person in a very long time. It was such a vulnerable moment it touched me deeply. I had never felt so deeply moved. Someone cared. It meant more than anything in the world to me. She finished bandaging my arms, and sent me out to do the pedicure. When I was done, she sent me to the counseling department in the college. We had a second teacher in this class, and she was the one to walk me up there. She was a lot like the other teacher where she showed me a lot of compassion as well, she offered to listen if ever needed. She told me I could even come before class to do so. Thanks to that day that classroom became a place I felt a little safer and a little more comfortable. It was nice. I didn't have anything like that at that time. Thanks to them, the words they said, and their actions I'm still fighting. The compassion they showed me sort of opened my eyes. I can and do matter. I'm still struggling, but I'd say I'm doing much better than I was. I hope I can get in contact with them again so I can thank them. I'll be forever grateful.",1

Donner gathered the rest of Santa�s sleigh team for another meeting behind the workshop,

Except for Rudolph, he was off getting his hooves done. The pretty boy that he is. 

�Gather �round boys, gather �round�, Donner said, �Is everyone here?�

�Yeah!!!�, Blitzen shouted. 

�Don�t you start!!�, Donner said. 

Blitzen hung his head and pouted out his lip

Donner continued, �Now, I must admit, last year, was really...REALLY fun, am I right?�

Blitzen smiled, looked from side to side, raised his head slightly, and said, �Yeah�, then lowered his head quickly

�Who said that? Was that you, Blitzen?�, Donner asked. 

There was no response

Donner continued, �Although, last year WAS fun, Santa was really, really mad, I mean, he wouldn�t even let us frolic with the foes for two whole weeks. 

So, this year, we�re going to have a nice, normal Christmas Eve run, no shenanigans, everyone got it!!!�

�Yeah�, Blitzen said loudly

�That�s it!!!, I knew THAT was you, no fruit cake for you, young man�, Donner said. 

Blitzen snorted at him

�Okay!!� Donner said, �Hooves in, everyone, on three.�

�1...2...3�, he said. 

�REINDEER�S RULE!!!�, they all. shouted, then went about their daily routine. 

As the days passed, it was business as usual. 

Although, Santa did keep a close eye on the elves, who would sometimes slip the reindeer�s extra food.

He DID NOT want a replay of last year. 

Anyway, Christmas Eve came, Santa gathered the team and harnessed them to the sleigh. 

Rudolph was last to arrive, as usual. 
He was too busy getting his tail fluffed. 

�Everything okay, Donner�, Santa said, questionably 

�Yes, Santa. Everything is A-Okay� Donner replied. 

�Good, Now, lets get to it�, Santa said. 

The elves loaded the sleigh with presents, Santa gave Mrs. Claus a kiss and away they went. 

Their first stop, the U. S. of A. 

Now, by this time, everyone in the whole entire world had heard about what happened last year and they did not want it to happen again. 

So, in every single house that Santa and the team stopped at. There was a huge piece of fruit cake, for the reindeer�s, as well as, milk and cookies for Santa. 

Because, as you all know, reindeer�s love fruitcake. 

Anyway, This continued on, through the next five continents, that being Asia, Africa, Antarctica, and South 
America. 

By the time, they left South America, on their way to their last stop, Europe, the reindeer�s had consumed so much fruit cake, that their eyes were bulging out of their heads.

Except for Rudolph, he doesn�t eat fruitcake, unless it�s vegetarian. There�s something wrong with that guy. 

Anyway, during the flight, the team suddenly became lax in performance, they began to slow their speed, wandering off course, and losing altitude, and then regaining it, just to lose it again.

Santa and the presents were tossed around the sleigh, like an old wooden roller coaster, almost dropping a few bags in the process. 

Santa pulled the team together, delivered the presents to Europe and made it back safely to the North Pole. 

�That was a bumpy ride there at the end, are you boys okay?, Santa asked. 

�Just a little tired Santa, that�s all�, Donner replied. 

The elves unloaded the sleigh, Santa unhitched the team, and went to the house for some hot chocolate and watch a movie. 

Rudolph took off through the field, to go find Clarice, but that�s a different story. 

Donner and the rest of the team waited for Santa to enter the house, before they collapsed right where they stood. 

Their tongues hanging out of their mouths, and their eyes rolled back in their heads. 

Mrs. Claus met Santa at the door, handed him his cocoa, and they snuggled on the couch, watching �Its A Wonderful Life�.

We interrupt our regularly scheduled program to bring you this late breaking news bulletin. 

An Incident has occurred throughout the entire continent of Europe. 

As Christmas morning arrived, parents and children alike were looking forward to a day full of peace and joy. 

But instead their waking up to find what appears to be...

�Can I say this on the air?...OK!!!

They are waking up to find what appears to be huge chunks of reindeer vomit splattered all over their cars, houses, and front yard Christmas decorations. 

The wet, gooey brown substance is reported to have little yellow, green and red pieces mixed within it. 

Some even have nuts. 

There are no reported injuries, but, experts are saying the cost of damages are in the millions. 

We�ll have more on this story as it unfolds.

Now back to our regularly scheduled program.

Santas eyes widened, his jaw dropped, as his hot chocolate from his hand and landed directly in his lap

He jumped to his feet, and screamed, �Donner�

Donner raised his head slowly, and mumbled, �Next year, Blitzen...you choose.�

�Yeah�, Blitzen said.",1
131,happy,"So my Dad, who from hence forth I will refer to as Mick, used to be a car mechanic, his mechanics work shop has a fair amount of work being done durring the day due to it being quite a good one. And the boss had a dog that hung around the workshop.

Now, this doggo like a lot of them was very smart. He knew all the mechanic's names in the workshop, he could follow a variety of orders and even dealt with the loud noise perfectly. 

Whenever someone wanted a tool, someone who had the tool would call the dog over, hand the dog the tool, say ""Take it to Steve"" (for example), and he would take it to that person. He wouldn't let anyone else take it, he wouldn't open his mouth of you weren't meant to have it.

Now, Mick, as much as I idolise him, does not share my affinity for animals, he just doesn't like them at all, none of them. But this dog he seemed to get along perfectly with, he would let the dog rest by his legs, he would feed him quite happily and even pet him, which is something Mick never does.

He told me this story about a decade ago and it's never left me, I ask him why this dog was the only animal he ever got a long with to which he just responds, ""We used to think alike. Get work done, eat something we may not be allowed to, scratch our *rses, get back to work, go home.""

Thank you for all your time.",1
132,happy,"My childhood dog was friends with our mailman and it took my family a while for us to figure it out. My mom and I couldn�t figure why my dog wanted to go outside at a specific time every day. It was like that for months, we had adopted her years ago, so why the new behavior? Well we had gone on vacation for a few days and had set her(my dog) up at a...I guess dog resort of sorts because no one was was available to dog sit. When we got back home, there was a knock at the door. It was our mailman, he was asking if our dog was ok because he hadn�t seen her for while. My mom told him we had just gotten back from a trip, that he said � Oh ok, by the way here is Becky�s (my dog�s name) BREAKFAST BURRITO�. Well no wonder she wanted to be outside, she was getting free food. Every morning he would buy two breakfast burritos one for him and one for my dog. I don�t know why he liked my dog so much but I guess it was fine since they were both happy with that agreement. It was very beneficial for us in later years because my dog easily jump out of our yard, and would go wandering around the neighborhood with another pack of dogs, and our mailman would see her and yell at her to get in his truck, and she would and then he would just do the -mil route with her in the car and then drop her off at our house.",1
133,happy,"So this happened a few years ago after starting my job. The morning started off as usual, get up at 5, wait for the bus, hope the next bus was on time. The road leading too work has a lot of lorries parked on either side blocking the paths.
Around the time I walk up cars are coming and going fast too and from work itself. 
I notice a small jack Russell without a leash walking back and forth thinking that it's someone's. I spend a few extra minutes watching people walk past incase they call her, she may just be a super well behaved dog that doesn't need a leash.
I make my way off thinking somebody will pick her up when I notice she's gone, just disappeared I thought she must have been picked up behind one of these lorries out of view and carried onto work. Until I see her between 2 lorries and poking her head out slightly, she dashes into the middle of the road cars coming round the corner. I dash into the road aiming to scoop her up and past the cars. I ended up missing but instead wrapping around her like a ball ready to be hit by a car praying that atleast she would be okay.
Luckily the driver stopped a few feet away and allowed me to scoop her up and carry her off. Her muzzle was greying and her eyes milky so she must have been blind poor thing, a friend saw the whole thing and helped me away as I was shaken up but the pup needed hugs and calming down more. 
I took her to a local hotel as its the closest building to my work and apologised and asked if they could keep her for the moment, her tag had her owners number on but by that time I was very late for work. I was anxious about this but said my goodbyes and gave her plenty of hugs before leaving her.
I leave work that night and stopped by the hotel to inquire if the dog got picked up. I found out that they'd called the number repeatedly and after a few tries reached her owner. He was an elderly man who'd lost his wife a few years back and they raised her from a puppy.
His back garden gate had been opened or blew open and she toddled off on a little adventure. The owner cried and thanked the hotel staff for looking after her he'd been worried sick all day and all night. She was an amazing pup and I hope they're still together today.",1

She comes home looking exausted, since a whole football team had come in, and she had to carry so many platters of food that her knuckles bled. She asked me if I could cook a steak for her, and I gladly did it since I love cooking. She says she's running down to the store real quick to get some pinapple juice for a drink she likes, so I use the extra time I have to set something up. I put the steaks on a plate when they were done, added some noodles and corn, and lit some candles on the table so it looked fancier, but it gets better. My sister is a *HUGE* Disney fan, so I pulled up ""Be our Guest"" from Beauty and the Beast on my phone and waited. Right as she was about to walk into the dining room, I pressed play. Her face lit up with joy. She started laughing and crying tears of joy. She ran over and hugged me, and her reaction was priceless. It was completely worth it for her reaction.

I was 12 years old and very naive about sex. Literally I thought sexy was a curse word. 

It was picture day and my Nanna made me wear a dress. It was a very modest dress. It almost went to my ankles and the sleeves almost went to my elbows. 

I was walking to my next class when my male teacher noticed my hips moved in a sexy way and thought I would distract the boys. 

He was so bothered by it he went and told the principal. So I was taken out of class to be lectured about how I needed to stop being so sexy. I almost stared crying because I had no idea how I was being sexy. 

The principal went to my Nanna and told her about how sexy I was being in my dress and my Nanna wasn't having any of it. 

She looked at him dead in the eyes and said 
""Bluellan isn't trying to be sexy. She doesn't even know what sexy means. It's just the way she walks. But if makes YOU so uncomfortable, then I make sure she doesn't wear that dress again."" 

The principal went red and mumbled a thank you and moved away. And yes, I never wore that dress at school again.",1
139,happy,"Okay. 

So my little sister (M) is really white, despite being half black. The only black thing about her is her hair. 

She was in like the 3rd or 4th grade, and the teacher had them draw a self portrait. My sister coloured herself white and the teacher saw and said she had to colour herself black. 

My sister tried to explain that her skin was white but the teacher kept saying she was black so she had to colour herself black. This went on for 15 mins and at the end the teacher was screaming at my sister to colour herself black. My sister, sobbing, obeyed and coloured herself black. And I mean black. Not brown, not tan, but charcoal black. 

My sister told my nanna and my nanna was so angry. My nanna is a teacher too and you can imagine how this made her feel. But she actually had a meeting with all the teachers and principal a couple of days later. (IEP things). 

She went to the meeting and brought my other sister (A) whose a lot darker then M with her. 
After all the hellos were said, the principal asked my Nanna if she had anything she'd like to say. 

My Nanna said yes and stood up to her full 5 feet, looked directly into that teachers eyes and said "" I want you to explain to me, why you thought it was appropriate to force a crying child to colour herself black?!"" 

The teacher went pale and tried to studder excuses, but my Nanna wasn't having it. In a calm cool voice, she torn that teacher apart. She even brought A into the mix asking the teacher if she would force A to colour herself black. The teacher said no. And my Nanna asked why she made M do it when A is darker then her. 

After 30 mins, my Nanna was done. The teacher was pale and silent. The principal was red and kept apologizing. 

My Nanna sat down and calmly spend the rest of the time, talking about IEP's for my sisters.

141,happy,"About a month ago i got sick with an infection, and had to stay home from school for a couple days. During the infection, I decided that i wanted to quit taking my anti-depressants. (Not sure why I did this, but i did.) My infection healed after 2 weeks, but my depression and anxiety really got a grip on me, and a solid one at that. I did not go back to school. I instead spent my days on my computer, playing video games, watching YT videos, etc. I spent about a week and a half just sitting at home, not being productive, my flat became a mess. Beer cans, empty pizza boxes, and all that. At the end, my PC broke down, and it turned out it had short-ciruited, and i had to get a new motherboard. That's 350$ that i don't have.
I talked to a friend, and he said he had an older one that i could use. The catch, he said he'd bring it to school. So to avoid having to stare at a blank wall for weeks on end, I braved my depression and actually went to school the next day. I went to my classes and got notes from all the teachers about everything i had to catch up on. The strange thing was, I asked them before class began about what i missed. This was highly unusual because I am the type of guy that would rather fail a class than to ever ask the teacher about anything. The day went on, and i even stayed for an extra hour trying to catch up, and I was having fun. Yeah, fun at school. As a 19 year old man that is something that I've never had before. I was having so much fun in fact, that i forgot to meet up with my friend for the motherboard he was going to lend me. (I got it the next day) 

It's now 4 days later, and I'm feeling better than I've ever felt before. I told my friend about it today, and all he said was ""It worked then"". This was the whole reason he decided to lend me the motherboard in the first place.

If that's not a good friend, I don't know what is.

142,happy,"Some Information before the story: 
I am a 17 year old Introvert with Social Anxiety and Selective Mutism on top of that 

Story: 
On the first school day, I was thinking about what would happen when I would enter my new class. 
As a note, I have been kind of a social outcast since 5th grade and had to always approach people on my own in order to talk to them (before you ask, I did indeed have had always at least one best friend throughout grades 5-6 and 7-10, they would however always talk to other people and rarely approach me). 
Because of this, pessimism started to set in and I thought about how I would be an social outcast again, how my classmates probably didn't want to talk to me and how everyone will be in some sort of friend group except for me. 
(At this point in my life, I have already kinda accepted the role of the lonely kid, who is always being interrupted when they're trying to talk and just listens to the stories of other people)

So, fast forward to one month later. 
I am currently talking to more than half of the class, with classmates approaching me on their own. 
Not only that, but I also have found someone, who I understand really well. 
Another plus point is that the whole class understands what Memes are.

So today at school me and a group of friends where standing in the smallest circle possible, it was snowing and was pretty cold so group warmth right, but we where all kinda huddled up playing a game called insomnia (if you�ve never heard of it you whisper a question into the ear of the person to your left and then after they say the answer out loud you flip a coin, if heads you say the answer out loud if tails no one knows hence the name insomnia) well we where going along the circle playing have a good time the entire time I was just kinda resting my head on my girlfriends shoulder while holding her hands in her pockets (once again quite cold) anyways we are kinda snuggled up like that and finally it gets to her and she turns to me and just whispers in my ear �do you love me� the thing is out 6 month anniversary is in like 2 days and she typically doesn�t really do this so I can�t stop thinking about it.

I found it rather peculiar that he was walking pretty much in the middle of the lane. But he was holding some things. A trash bag and one of those long grabby things. He was picking up trash on the side of the road! Awww, I thought. That's so awesome of him! That's when the driver in the car in front of me put both his hands out the window and *clapped*. 

It was such a pure thing to experience and I hope that man continues to take care of the earth, and that person in front of me keeps supporting it, recognizing when people do good things and commending it!!",1

146,happy,"This was during winter of last year and I felt like I had to share here. Me and my hubby moved in this apartment in October and I was pregnant with my first child. I am very shy and don't really like talking to strangers often. On morning it got very cold and froze pretty much everyone's cars which is a normal thing that happens during winter. I also at the time had a job and was warming up my car and using a sraper to go to work. The woman a couple spots over from me was also getting ready to leave, but she didn't have a means of scraping the car (at the time). Now I got my car from my mom and she just so happened to have 2 scrapers. So I asked the lady if she needed one and she said she really appreciated it. I told her she could keep it but she said she already had one on the way and wouldn't need it much longer and gave it back. I imagine (since she looked quite young, maybe same age as me) that maybe she was a college student or had a job too. I sometimes see her too. Every time I walk by her apartment it smells like authentic Mexican food and I absolutely love it. She seems nice, I really don't know why we haven't become friends yet.",1

This story was requested by JoGyo as he wanted to know what happened to the guy who stole the magazines in my previous story �old man and his camera � so hear we go.

Cast:

Young thug: YT

Tired Mom: TM

Old Man:

This story starts with a young man in his early teens, he was from a bad neighbourhood and like many other young lads he got into trouble, he often went shoplifting, sold stolen goods and drank and took drugs as well as getting in fights and getting arrested multiple times.

His poor tired mother was at her wits end, she was a single mother and was working three jobs trying to support her son, no matter how hard she tried to raise her son right, he would always do the opposite, �because it was more fun �.

One day YT and his friends were hanging out around a quiet area and spot the old man who owned a small restaurant opening up, then one of the friends has a great idea,�let�s wait until he closes up and rob his ass� they agree and wait knowing that the old man takes his days takings to the banks night deposit every night and that he keeps it in his money belt.

At the last minute his friends back out and tell him to do it himself as part of his initiation into the gang, YT is unfazed by this and takes an iron Barr and runs up behind the old man to deliver a massive blow to the back of his head, the old man falls forward and the YT rips the money belt from the old man�s waist and runs off, before the old man passed out he got a real good look at his attacker.

The next day TM had heard about the robbery and knew that it had to be her son, she stormed into his room and didn�t have to search for long to find the money belt, in a fit of rage she grabs YT by the ear and marches him down the street in his pyjamas and into the front door of the old mans restaurant.
The old man was there behind the counter with a bandage on his head, the doctors told him to take a few days off but he didn�t listen.
TM pulls YT up to the counter and asks the old man
TM: is this the little shit that robbed you?

Old man: y...yes it is!

TM slams YT into the counter and says TM: he�s yours, I�m done with him, you can call the cops and have him sent to prison or you can take him out back and cut his throat for all I care, I�m done, he�s dead to me.

The old man was taken aback by this, as he knew his mother was a good woman, and for her to say this about her own son was very out of character, the old man looks at YT and decided to take pity on him and gave him a job sweeping the floors after school.

YT: fuck you old man, as soon as you�re back is turned I�ll be out the door.

Old man: yes and into an orange jumpsuit making a new friend named Buba your prison husband.

YT stopped being a little wise ass and reluctantly did as he was told.
As the days passed YT started to enjoy talking to the old man and after a week was coming to the restaurant without his mom escorting him,
He started talking to his mother about his shift at the restaurant and when he had to go to work.
His mother started to see the change in him, he stopped hanging out with his friends and spent more time with the old man at the restaurant.
After a few months YT had payed off the old man for what he stole but he kept coming back, so the old man started paying him a wage.
The money he made he gave to his mother to help pay the bills.
A year later he was waiting tables and even making the night deposits for the old man, and he even got a raise, 

the old man showed him how to cook and prepare all the dishes on the menu YT even had ideas for new menu items that he would make for his mother, after a while his mother only had to work one job and had more time for herself and reconnected with her friends.

Ten years later...

YT was walking down the street and ran into one of his old friends (OF) 

YT: hey OF how are you? What have you been up to?

OF: I just got out of jail for armed robbery, what happened to you.

YT: well you remember that restaurant...

OF: oh man, don�t tell me you�re still working there, ha what a loser.

YT just smiles at him and shakes his head and says...

YT: no... I own it!

The old man passed away and left his restaurant to YT, he works hard and made sure his mother never had to work again.
He went on to start a chain of restaurants that made him a millionaire.

The End.

Sometimes forgiveness and a second chance is all you need to change your life.

Old man: OM

Little boy: LB

Granny: herself 

One morning, the little boy was walking to the shops to buy his packed lunch for school, on his route, he passes the old tobacco shop and spots the owner of the shop standing on the opposite side of the street holding an old camera, taking a picture of his shop.
At first the little boy didn�t think much of it, but the next day at the same time he was there again with the same old camera, taking the exact same picture.

Day after day at the same time the old man took the same picture.

The little boy would watch him each day until he finally gets curious and walked up to the old man and asked,
LB: excuse me, but why are you always trying to a picture of your own shop?

The old man smiled and said OM: it�s a long story, but it�s my life�s work, hang on a second and I�ll show you.

He walks into his shop for a few minutes then walks out carrying a large photo album, he sits on the curb and opens the album to show the little boy the pictures of his shop.

OM: take a look and tell me what you see.

The little boy glances over the pictures and scratches his head, confused and perplexed.

LB:there all the same.

The old man laughed and said 

OM: look closely... the light is never the same, you see the same people pass by day after day but there clothes are different,
Then after a while you start to see new people, then the same people start to disappear and the new people become the same people and so on.

The little boy finally understands and is now amazed by each picture as he turns the pages, seeing the different cars clothes and people as the years pass by in each picture.

LB: wow...this is amazing, where did you get that old camera from?

The old man stiffens slightly as he remembered the old memories from long ago.

OM: when I was a young man fresh out of high school I started working here at the tobacco shop, one day I spot this guy about the same age as me, lurking around the magazine racks, it was obvious that he was shoplifting so I chased after him, unfortunately he got away but not without dropping his wallet, I looked through it and found that there was no money but it did have his driving license with his address.
I wasn�t in a hurry so I decided to wait till after my shift to call the police when I got home.
I look through his wallet again and this time I find a couple of photographs of him when he was a kid, in the first one he was holding a sports trophy from his school sports day, the look of joy on his face was amazing, he looked like he had won gold at the Olympic Games.
In one of the others he was with his grandmother, she had her arms wrapped around him so tightly and a face of pure love.
After looking at these pictures for what seems like hours...I just didn�t have the heart to call the police.
After a couple of months I had planned to return the wallet to him but I never got around to it.
Finally Christmas comes round and I�m determined to get the wallet back to him, I trekked out into the snow for what felt like hours, signs were covered in snow and every street looked the same, I almost gave up until by chance I found it, I walk up the steps until I reach the apartment and knock on the door...at first I hear nothing so I knocked again, louder this time and then I hear the shuffling of slippers on carpet, I then hear the voice of a very old lady.

Granny: who is it?

OM: hello I�m trying to find (name of grandson GS)

Granny: GS!...baby is that you?

Granny then undoes about seven locks and opened the door, to the old man�s surprise granny was blind, she reached out her arms to hug him.

Granny: oh baby I knew you wouldn�t forget your granny at Christmas.

Before the old man could think he just says,

OM: that�s right granny I�d never forget you.

Now granny may be blind but she was not stupid, she knew a total stranger from her own flesh and blood, and the old man knew as well, so they decided to play this game where he was her grandson and she was his granny.
They sat in the living room and talked like they knew each other for years, she would tell him about her friends and her local church, and he would tell her that he had a job working at the tobacco shop and that he met a beautiful woman and was getting married.

They talked for hours and were laughing and joking about everything, until they realised that they were getting hungry, unfortunately there wasn�t a scrap of food left in the house so the old man went out to find a shop that was open and bought a precooked chicken and some steamed vegetables and lots of other things, granny found two bottles of wine under her bed and helped set the table.
They feasted like their was no tomorrow, they sat back down in the living room and talked some more, then the old man went to the bathroom,
After washing his hands he turns to see a large stack of what were at the time brand new cameras still in there boxes, in a moment of madness he takes one and puts it in his pocket and walks back into the living room, in the time it took him to use the bathroom granny had fallen asleep.
He goes back into the kitchen and puts all the leftovers in the fridge and does all the dishes and puts them away.
Through all the racket granny slept through the whole thing, now the difficult part... he needs to leave but he doesn�t want to wake her and he can�t leave her a note, so he just puts the wallet on the coffee table and left.

Days pass and he can�t live with the guilt of what he did, New Years comes around and he decided to return to see granny and apologise, he finds the apartment and knocks on the door only to be greeted by a new family that just moved in.
Poor granny had passed away.

Months pass and on one beautiful summer day he looked at the tobacco shop that he would eventually own and remembered the camera that had remained in his jacket pocket for months and took it out and took a picture,
The next day he did it again, and again the day after and for the next forty years!

The little boy listening to every word was in awe of the story and told him 

LB: you did something so nice.

This shocked the old man 

OM: how was that nice? I lied and stole from an old blind lady!

LB: true... but you also made her last Christmas filled with laughter and she wasn�t alone, plus the camera you took you put to good use so it wasn�t in vain.

OM: I never thought of that... thanks for saying that.

The old man and little boy say their goodbyes and go about their day, giving a wave to each other each day that passes.

Years later the little boy was walking up to the tobacco shop only to see city workers clearing out the shop, the workers were taking the cigarettes and tobacco for themselves and throwing out all the other stock, including the photo albums and the camera!

The little boy asked what happened to the old man only to be told that he died, the little boy clearly very upset begged the workers for the photo albums and the camera only to be told to get lost.

A mans life�s work that meant so much to him was garbage to others.

The End 

Please let me know your thoughts on the actions of the old man, good or bad.

If anyone wants to use this for YouTube, help yourself and send me a link.

Back in the wars of 1942, Quack was residing along Old Town Beach. When all of a sudden, I piece of trash was thrown onto his beak. He screamed in agony. The other ducks in the pond were shocked and very nervous about this duck's life. They quickly called an ambulance, while the mommy duck screamed and cried in despair. And when the ambulance finally arrived, the mommy duck and the daddy duck raced little Quack into the vehicle, before it sped off towards the hospital. Later at the hospital known as ""St. Juul's Quackery"" took in little quack, and rushed him to ER. They tried everything. They oxygenated him, they took off the trash, and they gave him surgery, but it was no use. The damage was done. Mommy and Daddy duck screamed as they pounded their fists against the door. ""WHY OUR SON! WHYYY!"" Before the nurses pushed them off to the waiting room, with their screaming echoing through the halls, and a flat line echoing through their son. 2 hrs later, the doctor pulled the Mommy and Daddy duck over to the side and said: ""There is a way to cure this. We must do this one surgery, and It'll cost quite a bit. Do you accept?"" The Mommy duck looked onto the doctor with tears streaming down her face, as she signed the paper and the last hope rung within her heart. 3 hrs later, the surgery was complete, and Quack was saved. The Mommy and Daddy duck ran towards their son, crying the tears of joy, Joy! And that day was marked a holiday for the duck, The Day of Quack. And 2 years later, the doctors finally found out what had caused the ailment upon little Quack. It was but an ""UNO Reverse card"". Let this be a lesson to any other people. Don't litter, or more little ducks will suffer the cause.",0

155,happy,"I had a really interesting trip to the Dollarama when I was in Toronto 2 days ago. I had to get some slippers because I was staying at a backpacker hostel and forgot to pack mine. While I was waiting in line, I saw a mom with her kid in a stroller, the kid was maybe 2 years old and was cooing at the lollipops they by the registers. I think the kid was hungry because the mom kept mentioning that she'd give the kid some crackers she had as soon as they paid for it. 

Suddenly 2 other kids, one looking about 5 and the other about the same age as the kid. The 2 played with the kid and the kid handed over the crackers the mom gave the kid to hold. The 2 kids actually took the crackers away and their mom caught it before they left the store. I guess their mom didn't know because she paid for the crackers and left with it.

The mom with the stroller kind of chuckled and said to her kid, well I guess we'll get something else when we go for groceries. I offered to grab another packet for her and she was grateful, told me where to get it and I grabbed it.

I was well aware that I left my spot in line but I was OK with waiting in line from the end again. But when I tried to give her the crackers from the end of the line, the mom and the crowd were willing to let me come back to my original spot right behind her. She even helped to cover a dollar for me when I came up short on cash, saying that a dollar was nothing compared to the help I gave her.

I smiled and waved goodbye to her and her kid. It was a good day that day.",1

160,happy,"Nothing big here actually. A friend of mine introduced me to this girl who was going through a post breakup sorrow period. No intentions of setting us up or anything, I'm just a generally nice person to talk to apparently. :)

But during the conversation I told her something that she ended up screenshotting and sending it to me show me. I was glad it made sense to her and soon forgot about it. 

Fast forward a few months and I fell in love with my best friend. So much that I lost myself as a person. With the nature of our relationship and how close we were, I was stupid to assume I had a chance and asked her. The rejection was unexpected and shocking and completely destroyed my confidence as a guy. Everything I had held proudly to myself was being scrutinized mercilessly by my own demons and cast aside as useless or fake. I felt naked and helpless and was reduced to a person craving external validation. 

And then, one day, as I went through my phone, I saw this photo of a conversation. And for a second I felt I could really relate to what it said and was amazed by how powerful it was for me. And then, with a shock, I realised it was my very own words. Coming from a more capable and confident version of myself lost in time, those words were soothing and powerful. 

I'll just leave it here in the comments if it makes sense to someone else going through this. :)


""You know when you're on that lowest point, when you're crying your eyes out, when you feel so much pain that the entire world around you is a big colourless blanket of memories that hurt - that's when you are closest to yourself. 

Like when you're happy, you love the entire world. You want to do good deeds. You want to smile Nd let everyone know. 

But at your lowest, when you just sit by yourself, there's this love that comes from within. You know, like sheer love for oneself. You just sit beside yourself and tell yourself that everything is fine. There's so much power in it. It's profound. It's beautiful :)"".

Something he would always do when my grandmother was upset was he would tell her �you�re so beautiful or you�re so pretty� no matter the situation and it would always make her smile, making her day just a little brighter. 
I have gotten married to the love of my life since my grandfather has passed and life has thrown us a few curve balls between a cancer scare and other health issues. My husband has never met my grandfather but when ever I get upset or worn down my husband says to me �you�re so beautiful or you�re so pretty� and when ever he does it makes me think of my grandfather and how every hardship he�s faced he�s won or taken in stride .

For context, I am a short, kind of chubby nonbinary person. I was looking for a good job interview shirt with my mom, when NL (Nice lady) walks up.


NL is probably late 60s, cart full of cat toys/baby toys, and some clothes. I was with my mom and she watched us for a little while until she came up to us by the men's dressing room. I'm in the dressing room trying to fix my binder (a thing that makes boobs look flat so you look more masculine or androgynous)

NL: is that your son in there?

Mama: kinda, (OP) is my child. They prefer gender neutral terms :)

NL: how sweet! How long have they been out?

NL and my mom keep talking while I try on more shirts, and we find out that NL has a transgender daughter and her wife just had a baby. She and my mom talk about what it's like to have queer kids and how much they both love their kids. I came out of the dressing room with a shirt I wasn't too sure about.

NL: ""How handsome!! I really like that color. Do you like it?""

I tell her I do like the color but not the sleeves. She and my mom have me put on a couple different styles of shirts before we found a short sleeve button up in the same color. Mom spun me around to see how it fit and NL was beaming. She then told me about her daughter, daughter in law and grandson and told me that I was gonna make a lovely parent one day too, if that's what I want (it is!) and then she told us that God loves us and is smiling down on us (we aren't Christian, but the thought is still lovely) and went on her way.

A couple years ago I joined a FB movement called the Kindness Riot. Everyone involved pledged to do something to make the world a better place. I have 4 children and work, so my time is very limited. I ended up writing 10 random texts every day for a month. All with positive messages: ""You matter to me"" ""Hope you're having a wonderful day"" ""Someone loves you"" ""You are amazing"" etc. I was told off a time a two lol, but mostly people asked who I was since they didn't recognize the number, many thanked me when I said I just thought someone with that phone number needed some kindness. Sometimes I wrote longer messages. This story stemmed from one of those. (Paraphrased since I have since changed phones and numbers and no longer have a record)

Me: I don't know you and you don't know me, but something inside my heart said to tell you how important you are. You are an amazing person with so much to offer the world. I hope you are doing well today. If not, let this little message remind you that your happiness matters to someone.

Recipient: Thank you, Kim. My day has been terrible. I don't really think I should talk about it to a stranger, but thank you so much for the text.

Me: I am sorry to hear that you are having a bad day. And I understand about the stranger danger! I am not offended in any way. I truly hope that whatever is going on for you has a good outcome. Best wishes!

Fast forward 2 weeks...

Recipient: Kim? 

Me: Hi, friend! How are you today?

Recipient: Not so good. 

Me: I'm so sorry. Would you like to talk about it? I'm a good listener.

The recipient proceeded to tell me that his/her best friend had been in a bad car accident the day I originally texted. The friend had passed away from injuries the following day. He/she said that no one seemed to be hurting as much as they were, so they didn't feel comfortable crying on anyone's shoulders. Recipient confided that they were 16 and had never felt so lost. They had been BFFs since preschool.

We texted back and forth for nearly an hour. Me asking about some of the happiest times together. Silly things only they knew. And often reminding them that they weren't alone. By the time we said our goodbyes, they were lol-ing and sending smilies. Recipient thanked me and we parted ways. 

To this day I think of this text thread. I only hope the person I spoke to is doing well and is happy. I am grateful to the powers that be to have guided my fingers to that particular number that day. I hope I helped in some small way",1
166,happy,"One day when i went into the shower a spider was in the corner of the shower. I didnt mind him being there, until he started moving down the wall. Me, having a phobia of spiders, i splashed water at the spider to try to knock him down. It quickly climbed back up to its corner. I continued showering until i see it slowly starts to move back down again. I watched it and it stopped at one of the droplets and started to sip from it. It kept going to each droplet i had splashed on the wall. Definitely gave me a chuckle.

He then went on to tell me about how he used to work in a radio shack and throughout his life, he learned to play video games and get used to modern technology so he could have a close bond to his grandkids. Even throughout the game we played he was very good at it and carried me until we lost. To this day that was still one of the best experiences, I've had with video games.",1

It was the sweetest kitty I have ever seen. Normally I dont touch other peoples pets but it wouldnt let me go. We snuggled played and it was great. I wish my cats love me as much as this little stranger kitten. I eventually decided to leave but where ever I would go the cat would follow. In fact it was like a dog on a leash. I could not shake it even when I ran as fast as I could away. It was adorable (and scarry because I didnt want it to get hit by a car.) Eventaully I was able to distract it a bit near what I assume is its home and then I ran and it followed but only for a house or two. Feel bad for leaving it because it was so sweet.

175,happy,"Background: I moved from England to Florida USA when I was eight and then moved to Michigan with my moms new boyfriend at age 10. My new stepdad had three kids who were 14 16 and 18 at the time. The one we will focus on is nick aged 16 I think. I do not have the greatest memory so the ages may be different but I�m gonna say 16 cause that sounds right to me based on our current ages. I was sleeping on an airmatress in the spare room while my bedroom was being built and furnished. The only one of the siblings who I cared about really was nick as the other two didn�t have many interests in common. 

Alright now for the story. It�s short but it�s very important to me and helped me get over my fear of these new people in my life. My mom and stepdad went to go watch the 14 year old do track and the oldest was doing something else I think. I was sitting on my mattress playing Skyrim on my laptop that I had recently gotten and was feeling kinda lonely. It was starting to get dark out and I really don�t like the dark so I was a little scared too. As I was sitting there nick walked out of his room to get a snack and saw me sitting there on my own. He went back to his room and to my surprise came back with his super expensive gaming laptop and plopped himself down next to me and bottled up Skyrim on his computer. I smiled and we talked about gaming and other common interests and he introduced me to the AoT abridged series and vsauce. By the time my parents came home I was no longer scared of my new siblings and I now have a great relationship with him, my other two siblings and all the extended family they have who welcomed me and my mom into their lives. Nick introduced me to super smash brothers a game which I now have more than a thousand hours on total and have gone to a few tournaments for. There are so many things that I would not have discovered and so many friends I wouldn�t have made if it weren�t for him. Thank you nick you have had such an impact on my life.",1

177,happy,"Yesterday I was walking on the street with my fianc� when we noticed a cat on the road. We initially thought it was dead, but then it started slightly moving the tip of its tail. We looked closer and saw it breathing. During the initial ""what do we do now?"" shock, a car stopped and its driver asked if the cat is alive, then suggested that we cover our hands with something and put it on the sidewalk. I took out some tissues, but a woman from a nearby shop appeared to give us a pair of latex gloves. My fianc� caressed the cat slightly and then picked it up. As he did so, the cat started moving its head and legs.

We put the cat on the sidewalk, and another girl showed up holding a cat-sized cardboard box. We put the cat into the box and she tried contacting a vet that she knew, unfortunately without success. However, another passerby with a dog told us where to find a vet in the neighbourhood so we took the cat there. Someone else told us that the cat was a stray from the neighbourhood who had been involved in accidents in the past as well.

We brought the cat to a vet, who made a very good price for us (almost the price of a cat hotel!). It's a very calm and well-mannered female cat. Unfortunately she has a hematoma in her brain from the accident, but she's generally in a very good condition, improving day by day. She will just need to be in a place safe from cars and other pets and take medication for about a month, so we're currently looking for a new loving home for her. However, I'm still very happy about how many strangers stopped to help and how we probably saved her life.

Unfortunately I don't have a good picture, she was still in a lot of pain and looks grumpy. I'll hopefully have one tomorrow, so I'll make sure to upload it!",1

Here I am, sitting in class, all is well, then i come to find out that my history teacher at the time, had lost a project I worked really hard on (this wouldn't have been a big issue, but grades where slipping and i was at risk of being held back)

After I had found out the news, I pushed my chair onto the floor and cussed him out, I was sent to the office, and then the principle told me to go talk to our schools counselor so I could take a break and clear my head (he new i had home issues all my life and was very cool about the situation, i'm thankful for that)

I go to the counselors office, and she starts off with basic conversation. She asked what my favorite subjects are and all that, ya know, basic stuff. Then we get to talking about my home life, why i'm so angry at the world, where my negative energy was coming from.

After talking with her for a while I felt safe and happy, she told me i should get back to class and that if i ever need a break, to come to his office. Me, the principle and my teachers and the counselor set up times and days for me to come and be in her office (with parental permission) and take a break from everything, as i saw it was helping me, and other adults saw it too

She helped me through my issues and had helped me learn that id like to help people too, and shes the reason why i make myself an outlet for people to vent and talk about their problems because everyone needs to vent sometimes, and i wanna be the guy to maybe help them trough some stuff :)",1
180,happy,"So I live in England, Birmingham to be exact and I was on the city centre with my father and little brother, we where in town to see the black sabbath exhibit in the museum however it was 20� and sadly my father didn�t prepare properly which wasn�t his fault as we didn�t know.

So instead we went into the art gallery which is where me and my grandma used to go before she passed and I was 12 last time I was there I�m currently 17, it brought back a lot of old memories like a painting of a senate in Athens and a statue of a strange woman with wings that always scared me.


I always liked the smell of it, idk why but it was like an asmr for my nose I guess haha, so we spent a few minutes over at a child�s play centre thing which had little big planet on a gaming setup so little kids could get creative, where my brother was finished we walked through the gift shop which coincidentally was next to the exit where another exhibit, a strange box that no matter what side you looked at you could only see infinite reflections of the object inside and not the other side.


For clarification the place was pretty empty and knowing the area it was no doubt like that for a while.


Next to the box was a desk with an old lady who looked pretty down and instead of following my father I asked her about it and this is the conversation.

Sol (sweet old lady) me (me duh lol)


Me �interesting box, so how does it work?� I asked and she instantly peeled up.


Sol �Well Young man it was designed by the Russians in the early 1800s as a display case to show off exotic and rare treasures�


Me �nice� I smiled 

Sol �in fact look above it and pull see the effect in full� I did so and yes it looked like a prison full of mirrors 

Me �that�s really cool�

Sol �and if you follow me you can see the effect even better� I followed her as she circled around the bow and I all honesty I�m a huge history buff and this was really cool in all honesty as no matter where you stood the illusion of constant reflections stayed 


Me �thanks, that was really interesting�

Sol �the same effect can be seen in a mosque in India if you look in the right places� I think that�s pretty much what she said �in fact you may have seen the effect just not noticed it�


Me �wow, thank you that was really interesting, better be finding my dad now see you later� I told her


Sol �it was nice meeting you young man�




I walked off and returned and felt a sense of pride as I turned back she was smiling while filling out a form.

This takes place a couple of years ago when the Hunger games were super popular and the first movies had come out recently. I liked them okay but was and still not a real fan but I knew the 4 note whistle and mocking jays in the first movie. So my parents and I were out at a fast food Italian place. We were in the sit-down part waiting for the food and I hear a little girl (6-8 maybe) talking away about hunger games and asks her dad to do the whistle. I hear the 4 note whistle and get an idea so I repeat it.

I hear the little girl gasp and her dad say ""Did you hear that? There must be a mocking jay in here."" So now for the next 45 minutes to an hour, the little girl continually asks her dad to do the whistle again and I will repeat it back even after the food comes each time the girl giggling afterward. They eventually finish their food and go to leave and I hear the girl.

""Can you do it just one more time Daddy, Please?"" Now I am able to see them since they are by the door. He looks down at his daughter, ""I don't know if the mocking jay is still here."" And of course, the little girl gives the biggest cutest eyes ever. So he does it one last time and I look right at him and whistle back. He smiles while his little girl squeals with joy and they leave.

183,happy,"I have a small story because I think it�s very sweet and wholesome, yet kinda odd. 

Backstory: So I live in a small city, we see a lot of people we know every day. When I was in elementary school, I used to walk with this nice lady and her old pit bull named Harvey. We would walk until we got to my school, then we would part. We knew each other because my grandma and grandpa introduced me to this place at a library that holds a session where you can do crafts for about 3 hours. So we talk as we knit and bead or other crafts. 

One day I wanted to try a new craft known as punch needle. I got to the library, only to be told by a really nice lady that it wasn�t even a PUNCH needle, it was for embroidery. I had a small mental breakdown in the bathroom then came back out and my mom took me home early. 

I had just spent so much money on a kit, and all the tools, and I was pretty upset. The next week, I came back and did a craft I knew pretty well, and my best friend even agreed to hang out with me there. So we where about an hour in, the nice lady hands me a real punch needle and told me she would keep a look out for a bigger one that could use yarn instead of thread. I thanked her and hugged her, and as I sat back down, she kissed me on the head and said, �your a good kid�

That�s the thing I like to think of when I�m upset with how my life it turning out. I will never forget that nice lady who will ever have a place in my heart. Oh, and so will Harvey, the other lady�s dog. 

My next project is to sew a dog toy for Harvey, I may be a good kid, but he�s also a good boy.",1

Then the radio starts to talk about how people in Africa are having lots of droughts, and my little bro asks me what a drought was and I told him it�s how the people may not have enough water to live off of and it might be because it hasn�t rained for them for a while.

Anyway, a around a week later, it was pouring down with rain and my little brother is in his room. I go to see what he was up to and then before I came in, I heard him say...

�Rain rain, go away. Go to Africa and rain there�

WD= awesome waiter guy
Me: Microscopic evening

Backstory: I�m in the Sierra mountains for my parents� friend�s wedding, and kids aren�t allowed. So my parents gave me some cash and told me to get some food from the restaurant downstairs while they got drunk at a party or whatever. Also, I�ve never eaten out on my own before. 

Actual story: So I went down to this pizza place and had no idea how to order. You�re supposed to go up to a corner of the bar, but I didn�t know this. So I just sat down and stalked reddit. 

WD noticed me and brought me a menu and asked me if I wanted anything to drink, then went back to what he was doing. 

I went up and actually ordered correctly, and WD was super awesome and chill about my extreme awkwardness. He asked me if I wanted anything to drink, and even though I said no, he still brought me a cup with ice just in case (There was a soda machine so an empty cup made sense). 

I ate and paid, and when he handed me the receipt, he said he put a discount on for �being super awesome.�",1
186,happy,"This is long so buckle up.
In the fifth grade, a boy and a girl, Ruby (a tall redneck looking boy with black hair and glasses) and Neon (a short city girl with blonde hair and glasses) respectively, had a band class together. A few months in N gives R her phone number. They text alot, and apparently R's mom had realized something. Driving home from a concert she nudged R saying ""You must be really dim if you dont see it"" ""See what?"" ""That the girl likes you!"" ""She does not, we're just friends!"" ""Well i saw how she looked at you, and i know more about girls than you so."" Over the next few weeks R started realizing that his mom was right. He also realized he liked N too. He built up courage to talk to her about it, and asked her (over text, he wasnt THAT brave) ""Hey I was wondering, if you were dating anyone?"" ""No. Why are you asking?"" Well I was wanting to ask you If."" ""If what?"" ""If you would like to go somewhere as like a date?"" ""Yeah that sounds like fun!"" He was surprised and bewildered. He couldn't believe it. She had actually said yes! He was ecstatic, they stayed up until three in the morning figuring out the details, and decided to go see Jurassic World in theaters. When her parents dropped them off they had an hour before the movie so they walked around the mall. N bought them both mood necklaces with their first initial on them. R wore that necklace for years. But they then went and watched the movie, and afterwards N's parents pulled up with matching Jurassic World posters. They continued to go on dates almost every week (getting weird looks from alot of people as he looked years older than her) until 8th grade. He had to switch schools because of a high school prep program. After the program they both went to the same highschool, they were in the same percussion ensemble, same math, and same science. But everything was different. He was friends with the hood kids who smoked pot, drank, and partied. She was friends with the preps who never did anything wrong. He had low grades and she was in the honour roll. She lived in a nice house with a loving family on the good end of town, and he lived in a crappy house with a family who hated each other, on the end of town where people got shot every day. He drank himself under the table and she did her homework. They argued all the time, never went out on dates, and rarely saw each other. Then one day she had enough. She told me that she felt as if we werent even friends anymore. She said she couldnt take it. She told him they should split up. He was devastated. He never cried, but that night he cried in his mothers arms. Bawling like a baby, the whole time he told himself ""its my fault"" ""real men dont cry, so stop"" ""i drove her away"" ""i hurt her"" and so many other things. Months later he tried to date again, and dated three girls before he decided he couldnt. Ruby couldn't understand what was wrong. He didnt love any of those girls, and he couldn't figure out why. He started drinking again, and ended up texting Neon. ""Hey. Im sorry for everything i put you through. Im sorry i couldn't be there for you when you needed me. I broke my promise i made all those years ago. Im sorry. And i understand."" She text back telling him ""Its not all your fault. You have a different life. You dont have to apologize."" A few months later Ruby and Neon started talking again. Not as Girlfriend and Boyfriend, but as friends. A few months before Junior year, he invited her to go get coffee. She said she would love to go. When he got to her house they were both shaking, talkative, and really nervous. After they got coffee they walked to the gas station and bought some water and monsters for later. They spent the rest of the day at her house watching TV and talking. That day was today. I still love her, but have no clue if she feels the same. Im sorry for what i put her through, and wish i could have been a better boyfriend, but im hoping to make it up by just being her friend. She will always be the love of my life. But i wont make her love me. I wont do that to her again. Im better, i dont drink anymore. Although she never knew i did. Its something im very ashamed of. I love you K.

So because I don't really live where my family lives, I don't get to see them that often. So today we had a family dinner at one of my aunt and uncles house, which was amazing! Then me, trying to kind of fit in with my family, asked if they could teach me pool, which my uncle said yes. 

During that time a few of my cousin's and uncles came to where the basement was and they watched and tried helping me. Then, one of my uncle's (I'll call him uncle J) was like ""hey, what's that on your legs?"" Then I looked down and I was like, oh crap. So I was wearing shorts, which I don't usually do because I have a BUNCH of scars from stress and all that. I was gonna start to answer my uncle's question, then, my other uncle (lets call him uncle k) was like, ""those are scars!"" Which I was like, now they are going to ask the questions of what happened and bla bla bla... And as I was thinking that, my uncle J was like ""not that, I was asking about the thing behind her leg!"" As I looked back, there was a spider web that my uncle k threw on to me by accident, which I didn't see, in which I was like come on man! And that was that.

I guess it really wasn't a big move, but now that I'm thinking and typing this, I'm really happy that I have this family. They didn't really care about my scars, why they were there, or bothering me about it either! They just, let it be! Which I was SO grateful for and honestly almost cried because of it. Don't really know how to end this xD but I do thank my family a lot. It was a simple move, but it really did warm my heart and made me feel at home.

Mandatory warning: I�m newish to Reddit and this is my first post ever to Reddit so conservative criticism is appreciated.

Back story: In the 6th grade I had to move away over thanksgiving break due to financial issues. I had 3 friends but we were thick as thieves so I was going to miss them, but I didn�t think most of the school would have noticed that I had moved away.

Any way on the last week had at that middle school everyone in my first period class had signed a giant poster board as a gift also gave me pens for others to sign it as well. 

Over the last week I lugged that thing around and just about everyone I knew at that school sighed that including people and staff I did not know well. It meant so much to know the impact I had on the school.

So ever since when ever a student, teacher, or staff member had to leave in the middle of the school year I would do something similar just to let them know what great person they were.

TDLR I had to move in the middle of the school year and got a giant poster board with signatures and ever since I try to do something similar for students, teachers, or staff members.

Ps. I am considering posting a picture of it so if someone could help me figure out how to post a picture on reddit that would help.",1

191,happy,"Ahhhh, ok, I just wanted to share about my basketball coach, who is probably one of the main reasons I'm still here today

To preface this, let me tell you a bit about myself, just to paint this picture a little better. I have gross and fine motor delay (which I'm happy to answer questions about in the comments) and multiple physical issues in my leg muscles, joints, and spine, all of which contribute to making me an incredibly unathletic and uncoordinated person. In other words, *I am not someone who should still be on a basketball team.* So, when I went out for a basketball team the spring before my high school year, I was trying to be realistic. I knew I would be cut in the Fall, but I wanted to enjoy what time I had left with my favorite sport. However, my coach had other ideas. 


She would show up early to help me work on my shooting form and stay late to make sure I understood a play, even if that meant having me follow behind her in the middle of a drill so I could see how I should be moving (something that's really helpful for me because I have issues understanding how to move myself). However, even with all that extra work, I was still the last person off the bench. When the time came for my post-season meeting, my coach cried when she told me I was going to be cut, and I've never heard someone say ""Yes!"" faster than she did after I asked if I could manage the team. 


I've been managing for her for a few years now, and not a day has passed by where she has not told me that she appreciates me. She celebrates my achievements, encourages me through my hardest times, and never fails to have my back. Even though I'm just a manager, she will do anything to make me feel as if I were just as much a part of the team as one of the players, including having me letter as a Varsity athlete (despite my zero minutes of playing time).

193,happy,"I've posted shortened versions of this in comments on other subs, and my cats are on my profile if you have a good hunt. I should really upload some more photos of them soon. 

Anyway... 

I've always had dogs. I grew up around them, was lucky enough to have a wonderful best friend of a dog who loved me unconditionally until he passed away at 13 and 3/4. My family got a Dalmatian puppy whom I absolutely adored, and missed her horribly the minute I moved away to mainland Europe to live with my husband. I see her every time I go home, and make sure to make up for my absence with many cuddles!

I spent the first couple of months living in my new country working on our new house and missing my doggo, but his family's cats were so kind to me. At the time, I was suffering from undiagnosed, untreated endometriosis, and I can't thank those sweet cats enough for teaching me how kind cats can really be. They bullied me out of bed to get myself (and them!) fed, they cuddled and purred on me, and spent time with me whilst my husband was at work. It was nice, but not the same as my big silly Dalmatian girl. 

We moved in, sheltered some very special neighbourhood cats for a while, and they taught me that if you earn a cat's trust, you get unbelievable rewards in return. I'm used to the instant devotion a dog shows, but the friendly neighbourhood cats taught me that devotion comes in many forms. After the house was finally finished (and cat proof!), my husband and I decided it was time for a cat of our own. I'd wanted a dog, but my health wasn't good enough for one. 

The first of our two boys was dumped in an animal shelter for being a problem child. Ziggy was apparently aggressive when playing, shouldn't be let anywhere near children, was a curtain and furniture shredder, and generally an all-round delinquent. He walked right up to me in the shelter, tail up like he recognised me, and purred his little furry head off. He cuddled up to my husband, was gentle when playing with another, tinier, kitten, and I fell in love instantly. My husband did too. 

When we brought Ziggy home, he purred non-stop for four days. He followed me from room to room, yelling if he couldn't see me. He was actually very good in the house, no wrecking of my curtains or furniture, and was surprisingly gentle whilst playing. I was angry with the previous owners for telling the shelter a pack of lies: my husband observes daily that Ziggy is incredibly gentle, using his paws to tap us if he wants to see what's in our hands, claws firmly in and eyes staring up adoringly. Being half Norwegian Forest cat, he's grown rapidly, and there is fluffy hair EVERYWHERE... but I don't care. I've lived through Labrador retriever shedding seasons, I've had worse! 

Ziggy is not just special because he is the exact opposite to his reputation, but he's also a therapy cat by accident. He has alerted my husband twice now when I've fainted (low blood sugar, we don't know why I have it), he's cuddled me through panic attacks, and when my endometriosis has been incredibly painful, he's been there to snuggle up and heat up all the sore bits. He also rescued his brother from strangling by alerting us that something was wrong, and we got there in time to cut him loose. He's a special boy in every way. 

Teller, my other cat, came as a bolt from the blue. His story starts off rather sad and upsetting, but don't worry, he has the happiest ending. 

My sister works abroad in Cyprus, and was having a nice evening stroll with her boyfriend. She saw a group of boys, roughly 9-13 ish years old, pushing a small toy stroller/pram around with them. She was absolutely sure she could see something in the pram, so she went over and saw that the boys had been pushing around a tiny kitten. It was filthy, shaking, and clearly traumatised. 

My sister is a teacher, and was immediately suspicious of the boys' motives due to the shady way they'd begun to act. She questioned them in her best teacher voice, and in broken English, they told her that there had been a box in the street that said ""Free kittens please take"", and the tiny cat had been in that box. When she learnt that the boys didn't have any plans to take the kitten to a shelter or rescue organisation, my sister scooped him up and told the boys she'd take him home. She did. 

My sister and her awesome boyfriend looked after the little bean beautifully. At first, he was starving, hissy, and full of fleas. When they took him to a trusted veterinarian that my sister's boyfriend uses for the family dog, the vet explained that the kitten also had the beginnings of cat flu, and needed a course of antibiotics to get him on the road to recovery. Between them, my sister and her boyfriend worked all hours of the day and night, so they knew that they couldn't keep the kitten. Teller, unfortunately, didn't get taken in by their friends, and both were worried as he wasn't getting enough social time with them. As a result, he'd keep them up all night: not ideal when you both work in the entertainment industry and need a lot of sleep. 

My husband and I were helping them with their new tiny charge, and had been providing advice for them. We'd both got very attached to Teller, so when my sister asked if we could adopt him... We said yes! 

I flew out to Cyprus, spent a lovely time with my sis and her boyfriend, cuddled and played with the new kitten and made sure to enjoy the beaches. My sister, of course, was very sad to see him leave, but so happy that he was going to a good home with people she loves. 

Teller is a fiesty, rambunctious little cat with attitude to spare, but a soft spot a mile wide. He's intelligent, bold, playful and very independent... That is, until you realise that he adores cuddles! He's spent hours snuggling on my lap, loves to sleep on or in-between people on the bed (ours or the guest bed!), and is becoming a well-rounded and sweet little lad. He's kept his dinky stature (Cypriot cats are diminutive in height), but his personality more than makes up for it! 

The two of them very much consider each other to be brothers, and they're absolutely bonded. They wrestle and play-fight like litter mates, they groom and cuddle each other, and they entertain me and my husband non-stop. 

I hope that made you smile, and please feel free to visit my profile to see photos. They're incredibly special cats, and I'm very lucky to own them.",1
194,happy,"So ever since I was young I�ve been violent due to past trauma and SPD (Split Personality Disorder) and I recently got my school report. My dad (who I haven�t seen in a few years) saw it on Facebook and posted: �You disrespectfully brat taking credit for what *I* helped you achieved!�. My father has nothing to do with my life and is why I�m violent, he�s selfish and though I was a trophy to him, thus meaning me and my mother left him when I was three. This caused my SPD to trigger, luckily my friend was *online* at the moment as I had been playing Monster Hunter. It was the first game I got without my dad forcing me to do what he want in his way, and my friend said to me: �Your dad is just another person in your life, not family, a real father would praise you and help you with your medical disorders, like your metabolism and SPD, which *HE* caused. Tell him to f*ck off because he is nothing in the world, a speck of dust in the universe. (I took astronomy so him talking about it made me feel better).� After he said this he has to log off, I was in tears and could play so he moved my character using attacks placed a bomb and let me finish the quest. We finished the quest and I got the platinum award. If he hadn�t said what he said I would have the courage to continue playing and I wouldn�t of had the platinum award. Monster Hunter being the game that it is, my emotional support, my dad nearly made me hate it because he thinks *IM* a trophy would of made me quit the game for good. Breaking me. But one sentence can inspire me. After we got the award I said to him: �Go raibh maith agat.� He is from Ireland and if it wasn�t for him my self-esteem would be low and my SPD making me violent.









For those confused �Go raibh maith agat� is thank you in Irish",1
195,happy,"Context: I'm a 16 about to be 17 year old black girl with a deep love for both theater and and jazz especially from the 1920-40's it is my favorite genre of music and I sing it all the time (whether there's an audience or not but I usually love spectators). I'm also very sociable and excitable due to my ADHD which also leads to me being extremely talkative. This makes it a bit hard for me to connect with my peers, I have friends that love preforming, theater and singing as much as I do but they don't understand why I would sing Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald and its too hard to explain. I stopped trying to explain because I mean it is a bit weird to be a person of my looks and love the likes Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald when we have excellent pop music and others of the like today. Another thing I connect well with older people especially after my grandmother's death. And big surprise there's a lot of overlap between older people and 1920's-40's music. These are just some stories that came to mind this evening and you'll see why in a bit

Story 1: My mom had continued a tradition started by my grandma that my family this time around me, my brother, her, and my grandma would go to see the Rockettes in NY. So I was about 9-10 that particular year and my grandma and I were waiting on a street corner after the show waiting for my mom to get the car and pull it around. My grandma and I were talking, about what I don't know and we ended up on the topic of Christmas carols. She sang ""Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire"" and I loved it, she wasn't the number 1 best singer but it was still beautiful. I remember asking her to sing the song over and over again. In my little kid mind I had visualized something sort of out of the movies where people passing by would hear and gather around and sing with us. As much as I wish that had happened it didn't instead I listened to my grandma sing one of my now favorite Christmas carols. (There are more stories like this but this one stuck out the most)

Story 2: This has nothing to do with music but my grandma was in nursing home for a brief period of time due to recovering from chemotherapy. The nursing home was right next to my school so everyday after school I would walk over and spend time with her. There was this really old woman in the hallway and she was always alone with no one to talk to her. Every once in a while I would have to pass by this woman when walking down the hall and she occasionally stopped me and my brother to talk. After we would finish talking to her and walk away (we were sometimes a bit hasty and rude about it and I still and probably will always feel guilty about it) I would here her say ""Thank you for talking to me"" and it sort of hit me how lonely this woman must be. I doubt she's still alive but I hope she had a peaceful death and has a peaceful existence in Heaven.

Finally Story 3 and the one that sparked this entire thing since it just happened: I am an alumni for a leadership program and they needed a speaker to give a few brief words on behalf of the previous years (mine class was 2011) congratulating them on graduating. It actually was not originally planned for me to go and talk in fact I wasn't aware of a graduation but because for some reason the speaker was not going to be there and I was asked last minute by my mom's friend and had only a few minutes to make a proper speech. As if a reward for my stress MF took me to her house to celebrate her grandmother's 80th birthday. When it was time to go home the grandmother drove me and, like I always do, began singing Ella Fitzgerald. I hadn't noticed until my playlist switched to ""Blue Moon"" that the grandmother was *singing* with me. (She was fairly quiet and I had an earbud in a bit loud) and me being me I get bold when I realize I have an audience. I switched to ""Cheek to Cheek"" and she sang along as well. For the rest of the drive it was me basically singing Ella Fitzgerald to two very tired men in the backseat to sleep and entertaining an 80 year old black woman who, from the sounds of it, enjoyed every moment. I almost cried that after the probably excellent day this woman had (I mean we had lobster for dinner I think that a fair guess) I was able to make her day even better by singing the music I love so much. I love preforming and making people happy especially since my grandma had died, who was basically the person (most likely unintentionally) lit the spark for me to explore her music, I am glowing when I can make older people with music they makes them think to their youth and bring them so much joy",1

Let us commence the story......

I was at home with my dogs around me with one of them really sick..... he was dying, there had been many attempts to help him but the vet said that he wouldn't make it past the night, so I brought him back home and spent as much time with him as possible...
When the moment came I was crying my eyes out I showed the other dogs they're brother to let them have a last good bye

197,happy,"I listen to an artist called Girl in Red and her music has inspired me for a long time. My mom surprised me with tickets to a festival where she was playing (Vervenfeativalen). I was of course excited about it. The concert was 18:00, so we got to see other concerts that were earlier. 

I was in front of the stage at the sound test. I began to get nervous. There were just a few people there, which meant that there weren�t many other people to look at other than me. Nothing much happened until the concert was about to start. 

I was still standing at the front when the concert started. I had already hyped myself up a bunch. Then Girl in Red came out on the stage. I got so excited and happy that I wanted to sit down and cry my heart out. I had to squeeze my thumb until it turned red. I cried a bit, but I managed to hold most of it in. It got harder as more and more iconic songs for played and people became more and more invested. 

I was shaking at the end of the concert. It was so much fun. I became too happy. It was amazing. I hadn�t felt happy, and nonetheless that happy, for at least months. 

I�m really happy I went, even though I was nervous. To anyone that�s not in a good place, try to do something you enjoy. It doesn�t have to be a big thing. Eating your favorite food, singing a song, having a conversation with someone. It�s worth it.",1

So the past few months I've noticed how much my social circle has dwindled, and I've felt kind of bad about that but I've gone on with my life. Well a couple of days ago, I had a friend who I haven't talked with in months (and haven't spoken with on a regular basis in years) message me and tell me about how they just went to a farm and saw cows. She explained all the things she did with the cows, told me about all four of the cows that were there, sent me 10 pictures of these cows and the conversation comes to an end.

Look, it's something really small and really dumb, but it makes me really happy that, even though I haven't spoken with this person in months, that they had this lovely day with the cows and thought to themselves ""Brandon NEEDS to know about this!""

So today in my class my teacher told us about a chicken she adopted from a friend of hers. The chicken was constantly being picked on by the other chickens.

203,happy,"I don�t know if this is considered wholesome, but it�s something I wanted to share for a while. 
A few years ago an account on Instagram followed me, this person posted quotes which were sad, deep etc... I didn�t think anything of it and moved on, followed them back to be nice. 
I didn�t really see their posts anymore as my page grew and I began following new bands, new meme pages and my new friends. 
For some reason, one of their posts popped up in my feed at the beginning of 2019. I checked out their profile, noticed some pictures of arms with cuts and scars on them. I decided to dm them. Felt stupid for not speaking to them when they followed me, but anyway, spoke to them, told them that I�m there if they wanted to talk and that I�m always willing to help. They told me to speak to them on their main account. So I followed and here�s the turning point I guess, it was a girl, probably one year older than me, she seemed so happy in her posts. Then I realized, we will never know what others go through (most of the time). This realization hit me pretty hard because I�m apathetic and careless most of the time... This girl seemed to be okay, so happy, full of life, but her second account said otherwise. I learned that she had a boyfriend, tons of friends, she seemed to be perfectly fine. 
I guess I just wanted to say that we should think about others before we make a rude remark, or say something hurtful... take others into consideration.

Me: large hairy man
Gm: girls mom 
Sg: sweet girl

I volunteer at a food bank that has a big event once a month called distribution week. It's where people who qualify can get the food they need for the month. And on occasion we have a small box of random candy we find that we give to kids with parents permission of course. I was at the first table in line explaining to people how stuff worked and sending them down the line. It was about halfway through the day when a large family of 2 mouthers and 6 kids came through. The adults didn't know to much English as they had just come to the usa and weren't doing well in the December wether as they all were in big coats.

I asked both mom's if the pack of knee highs would want so sweets and they said yes. So I spent some time holding the box out making sure they all got one before I put it back behind me. When they were done I put it away but a little girl in the cart didn't appear to want anything and was looking at her mom something saying ""kneepop"". I didn't understand what that meant so looked to see if she wanted something on the table and I saw she was pointing at the knitted hats on my table and thought she wanted one. I spent some time helping the family pick one out for each kid. Even getting a really cute sparkling purple one for the cart girl that kinda matched her mother's head wrap (sorry I didn't know the name for it ). 

All warm and ready I sent them down the line except the little girl kept looking at her mom saying "" kneepop kneepop kneepop"". I didn't think much of it cuz I was used to cranky kids in the line. I thought it was over till her mom came back up the line 15 minutes later the little girl next to her and pointing at me saying ""kneepop kneepop"". (This is what our conversation went like)

Sg: kneepop

Gm: I'm sorry she wants (points at something )

Me: oh she wants a did she want the pink hat 

Gm: no sorry she wants sweet

Sg: kneepop 

Me:* grabs the box and picks up a random chocolate* of you wanted this one

Sg: * shakes head no* kneepop 

Gm: she wants the umm stick one 

It was then I realized that kneepop was her world for lollipop and she had seen the only lollipop in the box but couldn't grab it in time. I then dig it out of the box to see her with a sweet smile nodding and saying excited ""kneepop"". I hand it to her with a apology for the mishap. the little girl gives me a happy thank you in the way that could melt glaciers before they make their way back to the other down the line.

212,happy,"I (22F) was shopping with my boyfriend (23M) at Meijer. He had gone one way to get something and I went down the frozen food section to get some ice cream. The aisle was crowded and I had to slide past some people to get to where I wanted to go. I always make it a point to say excuse me and I�m sorry when I pass people, because I know it�s an inconvenience and it�s just common courtesy (well, I guess it�s not too common anymore). 

As I was going down the aisle, I passed this old man and said �excuse me, I�m sorry sir� as I went past him and went on my merry way. He passed me a minute later, and I noticed him staring at me. I gave him a friendly smile and I turned around to grab ice cream. When I turned back around, he was standing next to me holding something out to me. Unfortunately for him, I�m easy to scare and I screamed bloody murder. 

After I calmed down, I looked down at what he was holding and noticed he was handing me $10. I looked back up and asked him what that was for. He said �you said excuse me and that was plenty nice of you. Not many people are like that anymore.� I asked him if he was sure he wanted to give that to me. He said yes he did. I said thank you so much and he went on his way. It was a bit of an odd experience but extremely kind on his part! It�s worth it to be kind and polite, not to be rewarded, but for what it can do to someone�s day. A little kindness goes a long way and what he did made my day, even my week.",1

So i know what situation he was in and i help him when i could,i send some money to his wife,and pay for her medical check etc, so larry got ou of the jail and invited me for some dinner at his house,and we talked for a bit,and he told me that he still have some problem, he is having problem looking for a job because his criminal record and something like that, luckly i knew someone that have a small motel, so i recomended larry to him and he accepted him,when i tell larry about his new job he cried on spot,he hugged me and say thank you etc .

The reason i make this post is not to telling people that im kind or something like that, the reason is i want people to understand that not all crimal is bad people, some of the just a desprate people that take the wrong choice

215,happy,"so last night, we were talking and I said �I�ll be right back, don�t fall asleep� (of course she fell asleep lmao) but I wasn�t mad. She needs more sleep more than I do, but I did go to sleep fairly soon after. Whenever she falls asleep when we�re texting she feels it her girlfriend-ly duty to apologize, and I always remind her that there�s no need to apologize and assure her that I�m, in fact, glad she�s sleeping. So in my goodnight text, I told her to not worry about it and not to say sorry, knowing she�d unnecessarily say sorry and feel bad. when she woke up, she apologized but not in the usual way, to my pleasant surprise (she listened for the most part lmao). For a little bit of background for you guys, we always talk about our future together and how we�re gonna make it, and we really believe that we�re soulmates, that we didn�t meet by chance, but instead by fate. She�s told me a couple times that she doesn�t like loud noises, which includes thunder. she told me this morning that she had a nightmare that turned in to a dream because I appeared in it. it was thundering and she was in (apparently our) house and I hugged her and we went to go cuddle. In the dream, I pulled a fluffy blanket over her and said �we made it ****. We did it.� And she (again, in the dream) was confused and was like �huh?� And I said �everything we talked about when we were kids, we made it� and i told her that i don�t think it was a dream, but a premonition. I really hope she and i last a lifetime. You don�t understand how much she means to me guys??",1
216,happy,"Heyyo this is my first post so pleade tell me what tings i did wrong so i can improve

So basic backstory: i play some .io games when im bored and this was one (it was bist.io). I was getting back into it and being top 1 on the leaderboard(Just for context this game had no communucation so there was rarley team activity)

So i was just waiting in a corner to waitijg for pepole to improve and 2(3)players attacked me wich was really not a problem but the 3rd one was odd... It just stood there and i didnt shoot(wich i dont regret) he starts going closer to propably say that he wasnt about to attack me and i accepted and i helped him get upgraded,and we got attacked by the top 2 wich got me by suprise but i killed him the problem was i had close to no health but my teammate didnt kill me wich i thoght he would... He could have killed me for free loot,but he didnt even shoot in my direction and i think that one got my trust on him. After i recovered we went back to farming,but he had network problems and suddenly stopped. I got what was going on,and i remember when i was spared by him, and it was that situation turned around so i defended him with my life but nothing really happend... And it happend 2 more times before it disconnected i was kinda expecting it,but i was feeling good that it happend,and then he came back with a different name(its name was random spam the both time). After a moment i realised that he came back and i was in shock that he accualy found the server and got to me back and i helped him again but i had to go.. So i tryed to tell him to get my star but either he didnt want to shoot me or i was bad at explaining things...

Well this was my wholesome interaction maybe its not the crazyest one but this is how far no cummunucation .io games are going(nickname was swoo if anyone wondered)

So a little back story. I am now 30 but have been metal detecting as a hobby for 20 years and have found amazing items laying in the dirt. 

So on to the story. 
The cast:
CN-Crazy Neighbor
AN-Awesome Neighbor
PO-Cop
Me- I will not abuse your intellect. Lol

So my family and I had just recently moved into this small neighborhood in Oklahoma City. Anytime I move anywhere I always have to pull out my trusty metal detector and do some therapeutic digging. 

I had seen my neighbor lady and asked her if I could dig in her yard the following day since I was off work.

Me-Hey AN! I was wondering if tomorrow I could do some metal detecting in your yard? I can even show you the items I dig up.

AN-Sure! I have always wondered what was in my yard. My dad used to do that, but he died before he had the chance. I am working tomorrow, but you have my permission to dig as long as you fill in your holes.

Me- No problem. I'm sorry about your father.

AN-Its ok. Its nice to meet our new neighbors anyways. 

So the next day after getting up, I went next door and layed my coil to the soil and started detecting. I found several wheat back pennies and silver dimes. (Wheat back pennies were minted 1909 to 1958 for those who don't know)

Just about the time I was halfway done with the front yard I hear through my head phones...

CN-Hey A$$hole!

I popped my head up and took off my headphones to see if someone was talking to me.

Me-I'm sorry? Who are you and why are you yelling at me like that?

CN-If you don't get off that property I'm calling the police! Your trespassing and destroying her property you peice of S;&@.

Me-Um I'm sorry but first of all I have permission to be here. You don't have any right to scream at me! You need something all you have to do is ask. 

CN started at me on AN yard, yelling he's going to beat my A$$.

Me-You step any farther and I'll excersize my right to defend myself!

CN-I'm calling the police! Your going to get arrested!

Me-That's fine. Go right on ahead. I'll keep digging and I'll let the cops know you threatened to hit me!

CN headed back to his house and about 10 minutes later 2 cop cars pull up. Lol. 

PO-Excuse me sir. We got a call from a neighbor that your trespassing on private property.

Me-No sir. I'm sorry you had to waste your time for this. I had gotten permission from my neighbor here to metal detect her yard yesterday. CN came outside and started cussing at me and threatened to beat me without even asking if I had permission. Even after I told him I had permission he still threatened me. 

PO-Is it that neighbor? Pointing across the street.

Me- yes it was.

PO-I figured. He's a troublemaker. We get several calls from him quite often. Normally we just tell people to pay no mind to him. If he causes anymore trouble just call us.

CN-Why aren't y'all going to arrest him?! He's trespassing!

PO-CN we already talked to AN and she gave him her permission. So their has been no crime commited.

At this time CN started cussing up a storm and such that PO finally had enough and had him arrested for disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace, threatening physical harm to someone and making a false police report.

After taking my statement and such they left with CN in tow. Didn't see him again outside his home.

Also I had found a 1940s Cub Scout pin that had turned out to be AN fathers when he was a kid. She cried and thanked me after I put it into a frame with a picture of the old 1940s Cub Scouts of America logo.
Love to all.",0
219,happy,"So my mom and I do respite care for disabled adults and there�s this one (let�s call him J) who�s 19, severely autistic, and nonverbal but such a cutie. Anyway, my mom, J, and I were all going to the local mall cause he loves the carousel there and the whole place keeps him entertained. We got to the mall and this is basically how everything went:
Me: J, do you wanna go on the carousel? 
-For him when he says yes he puts both of his hands on his head and when he says no he just shakes his head no-
J: hands on his head
So we walk over to get a ticket and the way we do it is my mom pays for the ticket while J and I wait in line cause he doesn�t handle lines very well so after mom got our ticket, we handed it to the person collecting the tickets, and got on one of the very few seated (non horse) parts and there was a lot of people that day so both of the seated ones were already taken up. We were just about to leave when a man and his daughter both get up and move to a horse
Man: here you can have this seat he (J) looks pretty excited 
After thanking his profusely we got on and had a great time going around and waving to my mom (J also loves waving to other people and blowing kisses at them too it�s adorable) so once the ride was over we got in line for a second spin and my mom is talking to his guy who is now collecting the tickets- we�ll call him M-
M: hey buddy! I haven�t seen you in ages! 
He starts talking to J and I realize that M used to go to J�s school. He lets us on the carousel twice more and we didn�t have to pay for a ticket all because he was so excited to see J and see him doing well. J was having a blast and communicating with M in his own way which was just cute to see J be so excited about seeing someone. M ended up giving us two free balloons with a promise that we come back and visit him next time. Now every time we go we visit M at the carousel.",1
220,happy,"I work in retail, so I have horror stories out the wazoo, but this incident always gives me a smile. Me: Me, CW: Co-Worker, C: Incredible Customers who stepped up to help, PM: Poor Manager who isn't good in an emergency

I had a CW who had special needs. Our grocery store regularly employed people with special needs. She also suffered from seizures. We were both baggers/cart gatherers, and I was also the utility clerk (janitor).

One day we were sent out to get carts. This wasn't uncommon, and I had gone to a cart corral to gather a bunch together to start the process. I looked down the strip and found a bunch of people gathered around and a car partially pulled out from its space. I went down to find out what was going on. CW was on the ground, C1 had her head in her hands.

Me: Did she have a seizure?

C1: Yes, I called 911.

C2: I looked on her emergency alert bracelet (bracelet some people wear that tells what their health condition are, what medicines they're allergic to, emergency contact numbers) and called her mother.

Me: Did you call the store?

C1: No.

I took out my phone and called the store. Me: CW has had a seizure in the parking lot.

PM: What?!

Me: CW has had a seizure in the parking lot. We've called 911 and her Mother. Letting you know.

PM: Okay.

A few minutes later the Pharmacist came out to check up on CW. An ambulance showed up not much later, and CW went to the hospital. Turns out, PM had panicked when I told him about what happened. Fortunately, another Manager was there and knew what to do and contacted the Pharmacist to let her know she was needed in the parking lot.

These customers were great! I'm amazed every time I think about it because they all stopped what they were doing (there were about 20 people gathered around) to help and make sure no one accidentally ran over her!

CW was back at work a few days later. Like I said, she had these seizures regularly.",1

Me: Pope Francis
M: my amazing mom
P: people(including counselors)
C: crush
Hotel: trivago

Backstory:

So when I was around 5 or 6, I went to a summer camp and I had a crush on this girl. young children love.

Story:

One day, I went to summer camp, and it was the last day of it, so I knew I had little time to confess, so at the end of the day, I told her: (exact words, I was mainly filled in from my mom and she had good memory)

Me: C, I love you, will you be my love?

P: Aww (about 10-15 people, including mine and C's mom)

C: No, sorry.

Me: C you broke my heart.

Hotel: oof. Trivago.

Me: *walks away starting to cry*

So later, my mom took me to some place that rhymes with dac monalds, which was my favorite place to eat.at the time, and I get my usual, a cheeseburger without anything else, Don't judge me, I was young. So we sit down and start eating, and this is the conversation me and m have.

M: hey baby, you sad?

Me: yeah

M: well look over there *points to a table*

And who else would it be other than C. I instantly look away and at my burger, than C walks up to me and m and says this to me.

C: hey, sorry about earlier, I was just wondering if you would like to come sit with us?

Me: *hesitant* sure.

So yeah, I went over and sat with them and for the rest of the day after that, playing with friends after getting home, was really great. I probably would have seen her later in life, but when I was 9, I moved out of the trailer park i lived in, which was the last one in Nassau county. I have a more recent wholesome story.

50 upvotes and I'll show a video of me moving out.
TL:DR: I ask out my crush and get rejected. She and i become good friends afterwards.",1

Hi all, before the story I have to tell you about my medical history. I have ADHD and sometimes I can feel tendencies of my medical problem come back. Examples: when I see kids run sometimes, a small part of me wants to run too but I know if I run, I won't have energy later or when I hear a song I know, I used to sing in public but now am self-conscious as others may prefer the original song as I like to sing in part. I used to have to take medication (**Dextroamphetamine)** and this is used to force concentration for 4 hours per half tablet and that was the dosage I was taking. On to the Story:

Cast: EK = Entitled kid EM = Entitled mum ET = English teacher C = coach me = My Ear

During year 8, (Sec 1 or 1st year of junior high) I had a bully who knew I had this medication in my special sandwich (sugarloaf) and sometimes would exploit me for my medication during the exams time. Sometimes I just squash the sandwich into an edible ball and force the ball into my mouth but one day He took the sandwich before I could squash it and he just ate it.

I knew from the first time I took the medication, you feel really high and ready to concentrate but the hangover from the medication was terrible. you have a splitting migraine and you are really sensitive to sound, light, and smell. Once since I got used to the medication, the only hangover effect I still can remember was enhanced smelling. I remember 1 saturday, as I just woke up and still in my bed when, suddenly I could smell curry leave and lemongrass, uncut. Then I knew my mum was cooking curry that day but back to the story:

As it was the first time taking my type of pill, he had a slightly longer dose. As I was heading home, I saw my bully, thanking the teacher while behaving like a goody-two-shoes as he was also heading home.

Next day, before school started, my bully's teacher asked my homeroom teacher if I was allowed to have a word with him, she agreed as I walked and chatted with him. He was the head English teacher and he was also a counsellor, he also knew the students that had ""problems"" and had needed medication. He questioned me if bully had taken anything from me, I asked him ""If he did, was I in trouble?"" He told me to answer truthfully and I told him about my sandwich and the pill and how it was difficult to concentrate in Chinese yesterday but since I'm from Singapore, I just pushed through. He then commented ""No wonder that little bastard was a kiss ass, yesterday,"" He told me I may need to stay back in school a little, then i reminded him that classes ended at 12 as there were sports from 1 to 5. He told me he'll talk to my couch that I could go off earlier as he and I had a meeting with EM. Day went normal until we meet for sports and the coach approached me, ""ET told me you had an incident with EK, you can leave at 4.""

Everything was well then C reminded me I had to report to ET office and told me to leave earlier as I had to shower (I smelled) and luckily I had the time to calm down from the anxiety from meeting a parent, thought I was going to be in trouble. I arrive at ET office around 4:15, he welcomed me and told me not to worry, I was the victim.

I saw the clock slowly moved from 4:15 to 4:30 then to 4:45, then I heard the EM stumbling into the teacher's office with EK in tow. When EM arrive at ET's office, I was still outside ET's office as I saw EK smirk thinking I was in trouble. I couldn't hear what was happening in the office but then EM exited the office came down to my height and asked:

EM: Did my son take your sandwich?

I nodded and was surprised at what happened next. I receive a gigantic hug. I was shocked why then she told me to enter ET's office.

ET had explained to EK what was happening to him as he took the pill, then ET looked at me and then told EK to thank me. Why? Why was EK going to thank me?

ET had suspected EK had ADHD and realize that after taking my pill, his attitude and concentration had changed like a kid with ADHD. EM had suspected too but every time EK was tested, he seems fine but yesterday was different. Normally EK would be struggling to sit at his desk to do his homework but yesterday, without EM having to scream at EK, EK started doing his homework on his own and had completed it without distraction.

Although this meant that EK and I were going to have a class together (Special Needs class) this meant my bully has turned into a friend but that also came with consequences for another story

This happened over 15 years ago so the details may be sort of unclear

229,happy,"I worked as a waitress for 8 years, but moved on after I decided to go back to college a few years ago. I had a family that used to come in pretty regularly. It was a mom, dad, and two boys, one was about 5 or 6 and the other was around 7 or 8. The parents were lovely people. Very sweet, very polite, and just extremely pleasant to be around. The kids were just solid gold. They had the best manners I've ever seen any kids have, and they were just wonderful. 

It was pretty obvious that the boys were adopted because both parents were white, light haired and blue eyed, but both of the boys were black. They seemed like a genuinely happy family.

I had waited on this family several times and got to know them a little bit. One evening they came in and had their meals, then ordered dessert. It was out of the ordinary because in all of the times I've waited on them they had never gotten dessert. But I don't think much of it and go and fix their desserts and bring them out. As I'm serving them the younger boy says to me:

""We're having dessert because we're celebrating!""

Me: ""That's cool. What are you celebrating?""

The older boy says: ""It's our anniversary. It's been one year since we became a family!""

Both of the boys just looked so happy and sweet, and the parents looked so proud. They were all smiles and it was beautiful. 

Me: ""That's so awesome! Congratulations!""

After I get back to the kitchen I have to take a minute to dab at the tears of joy and happiness that have sprung up. This happened about 10 years ago. I've seen the family several times since and they are still just awesome. The last time I saw them was about a year ago.

I used to work as a cashier at Knotts Berry Farm in a small souvenir shop that sold jungle related memorabilia. One day, I had just come in to relieve my co-worker's shift. She was leaving with her till in hand and I was carrying a new cash till over to insert into the register. I noticed there was an elementary school group of students browsing around while their teacher kind of hovered around nearby. I was always nervous with large crowds like this, because it's really easy for people to steal while using their friends as a shield to hide their activities. I wasn't about to drop my guard just because their teacher was there. I guess I was paying too much attention to the kids and not enough to where I was going because I suddenly tripped and dropped my till, causing tons of loose change to fly everywhere. I internally cringed as this was the perfect opportunity for some entitled brats to scoop up what they could and run off with it. Surprise, surprise, as soon as the cash started rolling LG dived down to collect as many as she could.

**Me** (trying not to panic): Sweety, that's not-

I was about to say ""That's not yours"" but before I could finish the sentence, LG had dumped what was in her hand into my till and ran off to collect more coins. I was dumbfounded and sat there watching her for a disbelieving minute, before I started gathering up the ones nearby as well. The rest of her class either just stared at us or ignored us, but nobody else moved to help. Once I was fairly certain I'd gotten it all back, I thanked LG and she just smiled and went back to browsing with her class.

I was so touched by her selfless gesture that I wanted to do something for her in return. After setting up my till, I waited until her browsing brought her close to my register again, then gestured for her to come closer.

**Me**: Hey, thanks again for helping me. That was really nice of you.

**LG**: (smiling shyly) It's okay.

She was about to walk away again when I called her back.

**Me**: Hey! If you could have any toy in the store, which one do you like best?

**LG**: (looking confused) A toy?

**Me**: Yeah.

She looked around for a minute, considering. I then remembered there was an $80 giant giraffe plushy against the wall and briefly regretted my choice of the word 'any'. Luckily, her gaze finally came to rest on something much cheaper. She pointed to a stuffed black and white tiger toy, worth around $15 or so.

**LG**: That one.

**Me**: The tiger? You're sure?

**LG**: Yeah, it's cute.

**Me**: (smiling grandly) Bring it here, please.

She complied and handed it to me. At this point, some of her classmates and teacher had noticed our conversation and were watching with interest.

**T**: What's going on?

**Me**: (Ringing up the tiger and charging it to my debit card) This is a thank-you gift to your student for being such a nice person and being the only one who helped me when my coins fell earlier.

I handed the tiger to LG, who looked surprised, but then smiled happily.

**LG**: I can keep this?

**Me**: Of course! It's your thank-you gift.

**T**: Are you sure?

**Me**: Absolutely. She deserves it.

I could hear the other students who were watching begin to mutter among themselves, probably bummed that they'd missed out on their chance to get free stuff. The teacher thanked me a few times and then they left. On their way out, I could hear the students who hadn't seen what had happened, ask LG about the tiger and her replying excitedly that she'd gotten it for free for helping the lady pick up her coins. It made me smile to think that she had a neat story to share with her parents when she got home and that her classmates might have been on keen alert for chances to help out other clumsy cashiers during the rest of the day.",1

Since there were 8 kids menus I automatically assumed it was a kid's birthday party, so I said ""Oh how old!"" (kids tend to get excited to tell us how old they are turning). She paused, and I thought ""Oh crap what if it's her birthday or the other adults"" but I would have taken an awkward older age a million times over her response. 

She said, ""we are actually celebrating my late son's birthday"" By this point her husband and children were there. Her children ranged from about 8 to infant. Her son had to have been young. My heart broke. I couldn't think of what to say. All I could think to say (and I genuinely feel this way) was ""I am so sorry for your loss, but that is so sweet you celebrate, and I can only hope one day my family does the same for me"" She smiled and said thank you with a tear in her eye. I took them to their table wanting to give every one of them a hug the entire time. I felt terrible. 

I told my manager about their son, and he obviously gave them their meal for free. We brought them a card and a balloon. On their way out, the mother came up to me. She said, "" I just want to say I am so sorry for putting you in an awkward situation, especially in front of your boss. I could tell you are genuine and kind, so thank you to you and all of you here you have been great"" I was blown away. A woman who lost her young child came and apologized to ME for potentially feeling awkward. What an amazing person. I know nothing will fill the hole she has for her son, but I can only hope she continues to receive the kindness she gives.",0
234,happy,"When I used to work for a fast food place I would always reward polite customers with a bunch of extra sauces(even the one you have to pay like 10 pence for each one), a bigger helping of fries or even a free drink. Specially children, if they were polite and well-behaved I would ALWAYS give them a (children's meal) toy of their choice or offer to exchange it for one they don't have yet or just let them have an extra one for free. A few years later I was working in a coffee shop and I would do the same with polite customers and well-behaved children: they always get an extra helping of whipped cream, a free pastry or even a tea, it always puts a smile on their faces and I absolutely love it. I believe one of the problems with our society is that positive behaviours are not rewarded like they should and this is my way of changing the world, little by little. To this day, I STILL get random people coming up to me and asking me ""You're that really nice lady who used to work at (place) right? I always loved being served by you!"" and that makes me feel proud and extremely happy.",1

So I go to an average sized middle school. One day I was just getting lunch with my friend Ella and that�s when we found him. 

We went to get our pizza when we heard singing. We look around and we see this older lunch man singing in the most angelic voice you can imagine. Ella and I just look at each other in shock, because most of the lunch staff at our school are pretty apathetic and seem to hate their job. But not this guy. He�s singing some Italian song that we don�t know. He gives us our pizza and says �have a good lunch� in a thick Italian accent and, me and my friend are cracking up because we love this man so much. 

So after that it was a mission to become best friends with this man. It�s kind of difficult though because he tends to just have random day that he shows up. It was a couple weeks after we first saw him that we got an idea

On Valentine�s Day our school was doing this thing where, if you pay a dollar, the school will deliver a Crush soda to your crush. But it wasn�t just for crushes, you could really give them to anyone. So me and Ella had an idea. We were gonna give the man a crush soda and put our names on it so that he knew that he�s an awesome person and that he made two random teenage girls hearts melt.

But we ran into some difficulties. First, to do the crush soda thing, you have to know the persons name. Which we didn�t. So we decided kind of became stalkers and decided to ask around. Me and Ella went to our English teacher, who is this really nice middle aged woman who was so happy when she found out what we were doing. We asked her if she knew him and she said no. But she offered to email the lunch staff to see if she could find out. 

A couple days later I went to my English teacher and asked if she had any success. She said yes and that�s when I found something out.

His name is Ray. He doesn�t work at my school but he volunteers there frequently. His wife of 40 years is sick and he is caring for her. He doesn�t know how long she has left. 

This was at break so I asked her �WHERES ELLA SHE NEEDS TO KNOW THIS�. She hadn�t seen her. I went looking and when I found her I told her everything. We both felt sorry for him which only made us want to do it more. 

We went to the soda sale and got him the soda. We don�t know if he got it but we�re hopeful that he did. His visits have been less and less frequent lately and Ella and I are scared that something might have happened. But we�re trying to stay positive about it because that is what Ray would do. 

Honestly, I don�t know him personally. We�ve never talked but this man has taught me so much. He�s struggling right now. The love of his life might leave soon. And that�s scary. But he still comes to my school, full of apathetic and edgy teenagers, and serves them pizza. And he sings to them and hopes that every single person has a good lunch. He become sort of a celebrity among me and my friends. Because we all love and appreciate what he does so much. I swear, everyday that Ray is in the kitchen, serving us pizza, everyone is just that much happier. 

TL;DR- Italian lunch man at our school sings to us in Italian and serves us pizza and always has a smile on his face even though his wife is sick.",0
236,happy,"Well, I know you probably hear about this a lot, but I�m on mobile so bear with me. Also I just discovered this subreddit this morning.

It was in very early January, my friend and I were attending our town�s anime convention for the second day in a row. The first day was a blast as I got to meet some wonderful people, see some great shows and win my first smash ultimate tournament match (I lost the tournament but that�s not the point).

However, the second day was were things came in. I was standing in line to meet the voice of Tomura Shigaraki (My Hero Academia), Eric Vale. I stood in line for about an hour and a half waiting for him and my heart was pounding like crazy. Behind me was this really nice guy (Let�s call him CD for Cool Dude) that talked to me while we were in line. CD complimented me on my cosplay and we nerded out over anime, Nintendo and all sorts of stuff. The line finally ends and it�s my turn to get an autograph. The way it works there is you hold onto a ticket passed out to you and then hand it over. There�s a variety of free stuff the person can sign or bigger and more cool posters for money. 

There was only one problem

The person collecting the tickets said there they weren�t giving out free stuff and you had to either bring your own item or purchase something. My heart literally sank when I heard this. A few seconds in and CD steps in and says he�ll pay for a poster for me. I was shocked completely. This random person I knew for the duration of the line was willing to spend money on a poster for me. We picked out a poster which ended up being around 35 dollars and I eventually got to meet Vale and have a small conversation with him. I later saw the guy on my way to the exit and I thanked him so much. While it�s small I�m glad that I was able to meet him.

CD if you�re reading this, thank you. You are a fantastic human being",1
237,happy,"I don't know if this story is wholesome enough for this subreddit, but I still want to share it. This story happened several years ago, when I was in high school. I went to one of those high schools that offer a french immersion program for english teens who wanted to keep practicing the french skills they learned in elementary school (it's a requirement in my country). Since it was in a primarily english city, there weren't that many high school teachers who could teach in french, so most of them taught multiple subjects. Because of that, students in the french immersion program always have the same teachers for their french classes for their entire 4 years of high school. 

In my high school, we had these two really great teachers. Lets call them Mrs. B and Mrs. H for short. Everyone in my class loved them. Even though they were teaching multiple subjects to us, it was obvious that they were passionate about teaching and the subjects they were teaching. They would both talk at length about it and actively get the class involved with activities, even saying their own opinions and comments about the subject being taught. Most of the time it was funny sarcastic comments about a stupid decision a book character made, or about how the Bible is organized. They would also poke fun at themselves and their students in harmless ways. Not only that, but they also genuinely cared about their students and do whatever they can to help them, like allowing a clearly distressed student to skip class so that she can go speak to a school councillor, or giving bottles of medicated shampoo to a student with lice who couldn't afford those pricey shampoos. Their classes were always a blast of laughter and smiles, and everyone loved them.

At the end of our last year in high school, my class wanted to thank Mrs.B and Mrs.H for being such amazing teachers, and for sticking through our teen shenanigans for the past 4 years. We all knew that it's not easy to teach a bunch of rowdy, inexperienced teens, let alone the same groups of rowdy teens every year. Simply giving a thank you card wasn't good enough to express our gratitude towards them. So, we pooled our money together and bought each of them a big bouquet of roses. One rose from every student, which means they each got a bouquet of 20+ roses. And we wanted to give them with a big surprise. 

Our classes with Mrs.B and Mrs.H were our two last classes of the day, right after our lunch break, with Mrs.B being first, followed by our joint class with Mrs.H. On our last day of school, during our lunch break, we snuk into the classroom and started decorating it, writing a big and colourful ""Thank You"" on the white board. Then, we stood at the front of the class, turned off the lights, and waited for Mrs.B to arrive at the start of the class. She eventually does arrive, and got a little suspicious that the lights were off when there should've been a class full of students. She turns it on, and we yell ""Surprise!"" She jumped a little, and looked a little confused. Then, it registered in her head what was going on, and smiled from ear to ear. During our 4 years with her, we never saw her with such a big smile. The rest of that class was spent taking pictures, and giving Mrs. B the roses and thanking her for all of her hard work. Now it was time for Mrs.H's surprise.

Since Mrs.H's class was a joint class with the grade below us, and they didn't know of our plan, so we couldn't risk doing the ""turn on the light surprise"" for fear that one of the students would turn on the light and spoil the surprise for Mrs.H. So, we hid in the class next door until the class started. The teacher was cool with it, since were won't be staying there for long. Mrs.H entered her classroom and got confused about why only half the class were present, and why its only the graduating half that is missing. She asks Mrs.B, who was quietly working at her desk in the back, and, being the champ that she is, pretended to not know where we were. She also hid her bouquet of roses, too. Mrs.H, still confused, started the lesson. Shortly after, my class walks into the classroom, in line, and we also gave her our roses and said thank you and how much we appreciate her. She was just as happy as Mrs.B, and was almost in tears. She said how much she would miss us after we graduate, and then composed herself to teach this final lesson.

I don't know if Mrs.B and Mrs.H are still teaching at that school or not, or what they did with those roses, but I still remember that day fondly. Great teachers deserve to feel appreciated by their students.",1

This happened when I was a just a little girl so please do not judge me now.

So here's some back story my mom needed to clean out useless junk from our house and we were struggling financially in a very small cheap house the floors were staples sticking out from where carpet was removed and we always had to get pliers if we stepped on one. We now live in a nice house with not to much money as my dad just lost his second job okay i'm sorry on the the story now: We were having a garage sale just for a bit extra money and to remove clutter we lived in a small town not to many people so it was fun but there was one thing i didnt want to sell and i cried when mom said we were going to it was a....................................... Bell!

... clap?

yeah that's it nothing special but a bell I've never seen before.. :

okay wheres the wholesomeness? oh right in this section down here \\/

A lady saw me playing with the bell and looking extremely sad like puppy dog eyes from a kid sad and so then she went next to me and said (Hold on NL=Nice Lady Me=Me HM= Happy but knows shes gonna be annoyed a lot mom)

NL: Nice Bell! Is it yours?

Me: N-no..

NL: You want it don't you?

Me: Yeah..

NL: Okay!

She grabbed the bell from the table payed HM and handed me the bell right in from of her!

HM: ? Oh! Thank you so much! (She looked at me) Did you say thank you? :)

NL: Ye

Me: (Interrupting like a kid) Thank you so much!!! (Hugging NL)

NL: Awwwwwww

HM: Thank you you really didn't have to-

242,happy,"This story happened back in December of 2018. I had just spent a whole month with my parents in CO after not seeing them since April. I was flying back to my apartment in MS and had to pass through Dallas international airport. 

On the first flight from CO to Dallas, my flight was informed that since we had a full flight, there might be limited space in the overhead compartments. They suggested that passengers in the last few groups should check their bags in. I was carrying my cat in her carrier, my backpack, and my purse. My purse can easily fit in my backpack and it�s easier to carry my cat by herself in her carrier.

I walked to the front desk and asked to check in my backpack. I asked if I am to get my backpack in Dallas or my final destination. The flight attendant said I will retrieve it in Dallas, right outside the plane with the rest of the checked in bags. Perfect. I grab my phone, headphones, and pack of gum and check in my backpack (with my purse and boarding tickets inside of it).

Before boarding the plane, I leave my backpack where I was told to do so, and ask the man collecting them also, if I am to get this at Dallas or at my final destination. He confirmed Dallas. So I board my flight with no worries.

1 hour and 45 minutes later, we land at Dallas International Airport. My phone was at 10% (as I was watching in flight movies and listening to music). I get my cat and make sure I have my phone, headphones, and gum. I walk off the plane and wait right outside for my bag, by all the strollers, and other checked in bags. I wait, and wait, and wait.

After the last person got off and the flight attendants began to do the plane aftercare, I get their attention and ask about my bag. Everyone got theirs but mine is no where.

They inform me that all checked in bags will be collected at the final destination and my heart sinks and I can feel tears forming in my eyes. My phone is about to die, I have no form of identification, my plane tickets and money are all packed up and being taken off to my next plan. It doesn�t make any sense why mine out of all of them was kept with the regular luggage but I didn�t argue.

My layover was 4 hours. I bolt out of there to find the nearest customer service desk. I call my mom in tears and explain as fast as I can all I can do. She wishes me luck and to update her if I can.
Finally I find a help desk and wait in line behind four other people, looking just as flustered as me.

Once it was my turn, I try to explain as best I can what happened and ask if they are able to retrieve my bag. The lady behind the desk (with the most painful smile) tells me that it�ll take longer for them to get my bag than for me to get onto my next flight and get home. Basically, no, they cannot get my stuff. I just loose it and break down in tears, very much ugly crying right then and there.

I was hungry, tired, and frustrated. I started to walk away, trying to figure out how to even get on my flight when one of the people in line, a lady and her daughter hand me a $20 bill. I began to cry even more and thank them over and over again. 

I rush to the bathroom to clean myself up, so I could make a game plan for the next four hours. As I leave the bathroom, I spot the two, smile and wave at them. I went off to get food, coffee, and water.

I texted my mom what happened, loaded the plane company app, was able to get my digital boarding pass loaded. For the next four hours I chased my flight across the entire airport, as flight terminals change many times using the main screen with all the flights.

I thankfully I was able to make it on my flight and get home 2 hours after takeoff, get my luggage and backpack, just in time to charge my phone at 1%.

If I could, I want to repay that mom and daughter the $20 that they gave me. They really helped me get through that awful experience. Glad to see that there still are nice people out there.

243,happy,"So, this is a longer one. To get started id like to introduce my mself, as far as necessary. Im 20, male and was 6 years single. I felt really lonely for most of the time, since i had at best 3 good friends for the time, and a lot of the timenot a single one. Also i still am a virgin. A lot of that comes down to me beeing shy. So, about 2 weeks ago i was at a party with my bestfriend. I had a few drinks (drinking age of 18 here) and he saw his ex, wich he knew was single again, wich he still has feelings for. She was there with her sister. Shoulder long brown hair, brown eyes and a really happy smile. I offered him to distract her. We talk for a bit, and i offer that we go outside (since i cant really concentrate and listen at partys thanks to my ADD) it was very cold outside, but it didnt really matter because i had a really nice talk. She has a high education, is noticably very intelligent, learns and works in chemistry and pharmacy development. We talk about our jobs and hobbys and friends, and after some time her sister comes out (my buddy wasnt successful) and tells here that they have to leave since its 3am, wich ment we stood out there for 3 whole hours. I allready got her number so i huged her and told her to drive save. We went home not a lot later. I wanted to wait till evwning the next day to text her, but she found me on insta around dinner so i texted her. We talked a lot the next days, and i asked her out, kinda, it didnt work out for Wednesday, but she said that she goes karting on Friday with a few people (i love karting and she knew) and invited me. We had a lot of fun, amd went later to 2 pubs, again we talked a lot and she later drove us home, but we allready said we where going to a club the next day, that day i was driving. I picked her (and her sister) up and when we arived i got. My one single beer since we'd be staying for at least 4 hours. I was in breakdance so i have some moves, we talked again for about 2 hours, and i really felt something that time, the times before it was very nice, but this feeling was just so much more and i hadnt had it since atleast 2 years. I was in love again. I often was thinkingbif i should. Go for the kiss but i couldnt get myself to it. She danced with a mutual friend in the club, wich kinda hurted me, but i was to sober for that to be honest. I apologized to here, and told here that id love to dance, bit just cant. At that point her sister cut her ancle on a piece of glass, so we called it a night and went home. At her doori asked her if her sister was able to survive alone for a minute. Following is the cringiest minute of my life but the best since a long time. I wanted to kiss her, but instead went for a hug... Twice. Then, to kive my self a kick, i asked if it was okay for her if i kissed her, and as she said yeah i finaly got over my self... This was my first kiss in over 6 years. The next day we went hiking and today she was at my /my parents place for the first time. Shes extremly nice and smart and also hell of a lot shy. Since that party 2 weeks ago im happier, and have no urge to masturbate anymore, what sounds gross, but this was a real adiction for the last year out of lonelynes. I feel liked and apreciated again. So to all the shy guys out there. Its okay. You sre great and deserve to be loved, but sometimes you have to give yourself a kick",1

HI, so I have just found this sub and I really like it, so I wanted to contribute my little story :-)

For most of the story, I am just an onlooker, the wholesome person here is a friend of mine and I only play a small part. To give context (it will be important later), I am a language nerd. English is my second language, then I have a few more European ones, and some two years of sign-language courses. I love to practice any of them (I am a language teacher, so I guess it makes some sense).

Backstory: my family has been going to the same small seaside-town every year for over a decade. We live there at a friends house and know most of the locals. There is a restaurant which we love to visit, because the place is one wholesome story itself.

When we first came to the town, we would go out for dinners (pizza etc) and at one of the many bistros there was a really hard-working waiter. It was a guy you would notice immediately - he was always nice, always there, fast, polite, and really good at small-talk with guests. After a few days we started to talk more and he told us that his ambition is to make enough money to start his own business. Two years went by, we became friends, he would still wait at tables at the same place, but on the third, he had opened a tiny restaurant next to the one where he used to work. Each year it grew, first he worked alone with just one cook, then with more and more people to help him. It is probably the busiest place at the beach now because of his personality (he remembers every single person that comes) and the evident love which is in the very foundation of the place. I don't need to say that we never go anywhere else.

One night we were having a dinner there when a man approached the restaurant, putting a few trinkets and a note on each table. The note said that he was deaf and in a tight spot, and was selling the things which he had crafted. I have seen this many times before and am happy to buy something, but I have also seen multiple people pretending to be deaf, even in this very town. I have some deaf friends (thanks to the courses) and hate people abusing this disability for profit, so I decided to try him - I signed ""Hi! How are you?"" 
The man smiled broadly and responded, evidently happy to talk. We ended up chatting for good 20 minutes about life and his situation - he was not doing well financially at all. I bought a few things from him and a few people around came to buy stuff too. Finally we said Goodbye when the restaurant owner stopped him, handing him a paper.

I did not see what was written there, but I saw that the man's face completely lit up. The two shook hands and the man continued on his way. The owner went straight to us to explain ""I have seen this guy around here multiple times but I was never sure if he does trully have a disability, there are so many who try to leach on people by faking. So now that I have watched you talk, I see that he is legit. I have given him a note to come for a free meal anytime he needs it.""

I was so happy! I am not surprised that the restaurant is running so well with this amount of good karma! I know that I have only contributed to a minimal part of this good deed, but it warms my heart to remember it. I think it is a good reminder to share your luck if you have it, and I now use it as an example of how You speaking a language at least a bit can help not only you, but somebody else as well.",1

I was waiting at the crossing so I could go and catch my bus when a lady walks up and asks if I want to share her umbrella. We have some small talk while we wait and she mentions she's going to the shops across the road and I say I'm going to the bus stop. She offered to walk me there with her umbrella. This is out of her way and would mean she would have to walk there and back. I politely declined but it just warmed my heart that she was willing to do that for a total stranger :),1
247,happy,So I don't know if anyone will see this but...yeah anyway i got a story to tell so yesterday me and my aunt and my two cousins went out to eat at pizza hut and my youngest cousin he's 5 was making faces at the ceiling (it was made up of glass he could see his reflection) and i came up with a good idea so i told him that the person he could see in the reflex was a doppelganger and if you caught it doing something different from you it would grant you a wish and he believed it and tried to catch it doing something else for a while fast forward to today i woke up early and went downstairs and got on my phone for a while then my cousin came down and we just started playing and i asked him if he wanted to see if his reflection did something different from him and he ran to the bathroom and started making faces he asked me how i knew this and i said fairy's told me and he didn't believe me at first but i told him they are really really small. and you can't see them unless they want you too so after a while he believed me then i don't know how but we started talking about leprechauns and how it was st Patrick's day and how they are as big as baby ants so to end it here my end started off with making a leprechaun trap,0
248,happy,"Backgroung: My friend and I both don't drive as we are on our L's and don't have a car. We are also both from areas with notoriously bad public transport which means getting to her place takes me roughly 3 hours sometimes more. We had organised to meet up and have a sleep over since we are adults and adults are allowed to wear fuzzy pjs, have a tea party and binge watch The Librarians (on the weekends when we don't have work of course). I have not gone to her place very often as we both used to live in college together so I am relatively new to the path I need to take.

The story: So I walk to the bus stop with my big over night bag full of goodies and video games and all is going well. Except I end up having an emergency with my new lease and have to do some online banking and go on hold for a while, and also keep the GPS up cos this trip requires 4 busses and some walking between stops and I have no idea when to get on and off without my GPS giving me a buzz. This drains my battery fairly quickly and results in my phone being nearly dead when I get off the second last bus. So I write down the rest of the route on my hand and my friends address and message her to explain the situation and give her my current location and eta so she can send her dad to come and pick me up if something goes wrong. It does. No sooner do I send the message and my phone dies. I'm pretty confident things will go fine and I wait for the bus with another lady waiting for a different bus. Both busses come at the same time except hers stops and mine doesn't. The lady with me even tried to race after it to flag the bus down for me but no dice. Both her and the bus driver offer me their phones to call my friend but I didn't think to write down her phone number. The bus I needed is very infrequent and prone to simply not coming and is also every hour when it does come so the bus driver tells me to catch a different bus. I thank him and he drives off.

I'm waiting for this bus also low key hoping my friends dad will appear and save me since I'm not very confident in this other bus but trust the bus driver none the less. About maybe 20 minutes later (and I should mention this was a very hot day and there was no shade at the bus stop) a bus that says 'out of service' pulls up and opens the doors. It's bus driver from earlier! ""The bus I told you to get doesn't actually run any more, Sorry, get in"" the bus is empty because he dropped off the rest of the passengers and finished his route then came back for me. During the trip he tells me about his wife and kids and we have a good old chat. I thank him when we get to my stop and he says ""no problem, this was my good deed for the day""

People are amazing and this bus driver is just the most amazing human being :) I have so many wholesome stories that I want to share (I am new to reddit) but I just thought you guys should know about the good in the world :)",1

For context: my grandparents used a room at the beginning of the house for my sister and my bedroom. The room was glass, So my sister and I drew pictures and posted them on both sides of the doors.

Now for the Wholesome: my grandma told me that my cousin( he's like 16 months and so cute)will look at the drawings and say Wow!! and when she says that my sister and I drew them he will kiss them! When she said this it made my day, I live far away from them so I enjoy hearing the cute things he does.

250,happy,"For the record this is my first post. Just saying. I don't remember the exact date this happened and I was 23 at the time and my girlfriend was around 20 (We met when she was 19)

*Backstory*: My girlfriend is basically a crazy cat lady (She would be first to tell you that) she has not one, not two but FOUR cats (At the time this story takes place anyway she has more now :3) She loves those cats almost as much as me and calls them her 'babies'. The eldest cat is the mother of 2 of the others and the last cat was from another litter. I'd been with her for a just under a year but had only ever been to her house one other time, she lives with two sisters who are slightly older than her and she has three older brothers, two of which have moved out but they still talk. On that visit her cats obviously didn't know me and kept their distance from me. Which I respected since at the time I wasn't much of an animal lover and the brother who hadn't moved out yet (Lets call him Mike) wasn't home on that visit, I had met her mother and we got on pretty well

On with the actual story: It was my second visit to her place and me and my GF were sleeping together now. We were just chatting about random stuff in her room when I notice the cats had gained more confidence and were growing curious about me. The two middle aged cats (Snowball and Trixie) Were both *very* curious and prodding me with their paws and rubbing themselves on my leg. The mother cat (Bella) was being more cautious, basically she walked up to my leg, gave it a sniff and then walked away. Only the youngest cat (Jackie) was still hiding from me. I should add that apart from Bella the other cats looked pretty close together age wise, though my GF never told me their exact ages, I don't think she was quite sure herself. Also keep in mind that on my first visit to her place the cats wanted nothing to do with me.

Fast forward a few hours and we're both getting ready to sleep in her bed (Its a big bed) Now as everybody whos knows even the basic facts about cats, they are nocturnal creatures, it was about 10 or 11 o clock at night and they were WAY more active, jumping across the room, up shelves, the window sill etc. This was pissing my GF off since she was tired and just wanted some sleep, about an hour or two of this goes by and we both hear her brother outside her bedroom arguing with her mother.

My GF, who was already cross and cranky at this point gets out the bed and tells me to wait, since Mike is one of those people who would hate his sister's BF just because we're dating and hes been know to get violent even with his own family members. I'm pretty confused and worried by this point since I hadn't met or even seen the guy yet. But from what my GF had told me, he works a very physically demanding job and is built like a tank.

I was getting anxious and actually scared for my safety by this point since my GF hadn't expected him to be home by this time I he was spending the night at his own GF's place. Since the bedroom walls and door are actually pretty thick I can't hear what words are being yelled, but just from the tones and general ruckus I could tell it was a heated argument.

I sit up and I can feel myself shaking in fear, I pull the covers off myself and get my clothes ready just in case he came inside the room and saw me. (I was just preparing for a worse case scenario as I still hoped he was a reasonable guy)

this is when the cats come back in to the story; they stopped jumping around and gather onto the bed with me. Snowball then steps onto my thighs and lies on them, I could feel him purring through my PJs. Bella and Trixie both nuzzle my arms wanting a stroke and so I do, again the both of them are purring. They both then snuggle up to my sides under my arms and vibrating as they purr. Even Jackie, the formerly shy cat works up the courage to mew at me, he slowly snuggles up next to Snowball on my legs and also starts purring.

I'm starting to feel much better with all these cute cats around me and I stroke each one in turn while the argument outside kept going, I don't know how long we stayed like that, maybe half an hour. Trixie at one point even tried to climb onto my shoulder to nuzzle my face.

Eventually my GF comes back in the room, I swear I could see steam coming from her ears she was that pissed at Mike over something. But when she saw me surrounded by her cats I think her heart melted from the sight. She gave an audible 'Dawwww' seeing all her cats cuddling me. Mike had apparently left the house in disgrace after their mother refused to help him out when he started demanding stuff.

And their you have it. The story of how I went from not liking any animals to being a cat lover. :)",0

254,happy,"Don't be deceived by the title, I have the irrational fear of dogs no matter the size to this very day!

So, this is my first time posting to the sub. But I have a whole bunch of stories I don't want to forget so I'd thought to post them here. Also, forgive me for the spacing, it makes it easier for me to read back and fix errors while typing.

When I was six or seven (around that age, forgive me for the vagueness), my family and I travelled interstate to celebrate my father's birthday. Which aligned on New Year's Eve (before you ask, yes my dad has the story of how he was born on New Years Eve ~~it's a trip though~~).

Now, this place was my great aunt's house, and needless to say, they throw the sickest of parties for every event. We are talking Easter, Halloween (one of my cousin's birthdays), Christmas and of course, New Year's.

So when my parents, my sisters and I arrived, we were greeted with my uncle's dogs -he had two-. One beautiful American Staffy and the other dog I can't remember the breed but it was one of those fluffy dog breeds, but he was named Chopper (the focus of this story). 
Now when I was young, I was afraid of my grandmother's tiny Shih-Tzu. So when I saw Chopper bounding around the corner of the entryway, I hid behind my mother's legs, terrified.

But we eventually went out into their spacious backyard and the festivities began. They had a built-in pool, a large shack at the back filled with adults that were smoking cigarettes and talking over drinks and poker. My dad turned to me and told me to ""have fun with your cousins"". I wished my dad a happy birthday and went over to my cousins.

Now around 11pm that night, I grew really tired and my older cousins seemed to notice. ""\[My name\] are you okay?"" I yawned tiredly and was stumbling. She simply laughed and kneeled down to me. ""You can sleep in my bed for now if you needed, come on, let's go to bed.""

I was a silent kid, not by choice sadly. Selective mutism ruled my childhood with an iron fist so I couldn't speak to most of my relatives. So I didn't say anything, only nodding towards her as she grabbed me by the wrist tenderly and took me to her room. I remember that it smelled lightly of perfume and the bed was a whole Queen-sized bed.

""Goodnight and Happy New Year \[my name\]."" She whispered as she tucked me in. She left the door open a crack as I fell asleep on the bed. However, I didn't know this until two day after that Chopper had entered my cousin's room as soon as I fell asleep. He laid himself in front of the bed on my side and nodded off to sleep himself.

My mum was coming in to collect me so we could go back to our other aunt's place. However, she noticed how I was asleep, with Chopper laying in front of the bed facing the doorway. Had my hand dangling over the bed, over his body, drooling on the pillows and snoring away quietly. 

However, Chopper sadly passed away of an illness I can't recall two years later. I remember being so devastated that I wanted him to come back, I refused to go to school that day he passed away. 

I'm afraid of dogs, yet I loved that dog with all of my heart. I still do, and I want to remember this story.

Thank you for reading.",0

So when I was little, like in kindergarten I don't remember much but I remember i called uncle Aaron ""Prince Charming"" because he looked like the dude from my story books.

256,happy,"So, a bit of background: I'm a white male grad student in my sixth semester, and I've been growing my hair out since the start of grad school. Recently, I decided to have my hair cut short and donated, mostly because I was tired of the maintenance required to keep it neat and fed up with parts of my ponytail getting caught wrong and pulling, or coming loose and flying in my face all the time.

So on Ash Wednesday (March 6), I went into a hair salon right near my apartment. The stylist was very pleasant and supportive of my intention to donate my hair. She pulled it together into four separate braids, front and back, and cut the braids off with a trimmer. So far, so good.

While she was doing the rest of my haircut, she suddenly stopped and drew my attention to the front desk nearby. There was a gentleman there, paying for his own haircut. He noted that I was donating my hair, which I confirmed. Then, *he asked me if HE could pay for MY haircut.*

I. Was. Floored.

At first, I had no idea how to respond. I told him that he didn't have to, that I was willing and able to pay for my own haircut, but he insisted. He thanked and complimented me for doing such a kind thing for someone with hair loss. After he left, the stylist and I chatted a bit about what just happened, still amazed.

Then he *came back* and asked if he could take a picture of my braids to share on social media.

Forget *floored*, I think my jaw hit *bedrock.*

I was so stunned by this sequence of events. I didn't even try to rationalize it as just a coincidence. As I walked home, I said a very heartfelt Rosary in thanksgiving, not for the free haircut, but for the existence of such kind, generous people. I normally don't ascribe events like this to the direct action of God, but I can't help but suspect that in this instance, God was working through that gentleman to remind me of something.

Lent is traditionally observed through prayer, fasting, and almsgiving. I decided to give my excess hair to a child with hair loss. That gentleman insisted on paying for my haircut out of the goodness of his heart. And God, out of the fullness of his goodness, gave to both of us a spirit of kindness and generosity.

Anyway I broke my glasses by accidentally sitting on them. I was like ""ok whatever. I'll just get some tape and fix them like that."" But after 2 days they just kept getting worse. At work i decided to take them off for good because I was getting annoyed at fixing them every 5 seconds. So I told my parents about it and told them that I was going to get new ones in a couple weeks. Then Monday morning while I was at school. I get a call down to the office because there was a social worker there who wanted to talk to me about getting new glasses. I told her,

Me: I'm saving for glasses. I was going tobget them on the 7th (when this happened it was Monday 4th) but 1: I have to work that day, and 2: my mom told me to save up.

SW: Well, we're going to pay for your glasses.

Me: *stunned, almost choked up* I feel like I should owe you something in return.

SW: The only thing you owe me is straight A's and perfect attendance.

Me: Well, you're already getting a perfect attendance out of me. (Lol)

SW: Well you keep that up and you get new glasses. I have to figure some things out at the office, after that I'll send a message to the school and all you have to do is make an appointment with the optometrist.

Now since I didn't have school the past couple of days, (I go to a community high school, so I got my classes done early) I have to wait until Monday to go in and see if I have a message from the Social Worker.

264,happy,"This is just a short lil story, but oh well.

I've had my female cat (Belle) for 6 years. We used to spend every moment I was home with one another. 5 years later, we got my male cat, Gryffin. I didn't stop spending time with her, but I had to balance it out with Gryffin, so naturally Belle started to resent him. She hisses at him and will even try and slap him (not scratch, just SLAP).

One day, one of our dogs snuck upstairs. The dogs aren't allowed upstairs, because the cats usually stay upstairs and they were scared of them.
This was back when Gryffin was smaller, and terrified of the dogs (he's besties with both them now, even though they're like 5x as big as him aha). So Gryffin had darted into my bathroom while Luna (the dog) was hard on his paws. I went into my bathroom to find Belle standing right between the two, hissing and swiping at my dog. Luna eventually ran out, and I led her farther away so I could go back and take her downstairs later.
I went to make sure the cats were okay. They both were. Now I know cats can't feel human emotions or anything, but the next part was so real that they must.
Gryffin looked at Belle from where he hid, all surprised and thankful that she ""saved"" him (Luna isn't mean or anything, but he was small). Belle looked at him, huffed in what I'd call embarrassment and fled the scene.

Nowadays, Belle is still pretty rude to him and does still scare him off a lot, but she's gotten quite a bit gentler with him. I even saw them laying in the same bed once, just a few inches apart. Even when Belle tries to fight him, he thinks she's playing and gladly plays along. I think she enjoys it, too, but she'll never openly show it.",0

While standing in line at the local Walmart, waiting to pay for my stuff. 

There was a woman, about mid 30�s, standing in line, in front of me. She had her daughter with her. The little girl looked to be about 5 or 6. 

Anyway, I was standing in line about ten minutes, when another woman, also in her mid 30�s, and her daughter walked in line behind me. The only difference was, this girl looked to be about 9 or 10. She was carrying a little Elmo purse

I heard the first little girl say, �Mommy, can I have a purse like that?�, pointing at the Elmo purse. Sadness grow on her mother�s face as she said to her, �I�m sorry, honey, Mommy doesn�t have the money for things like that since Daddy died.�

The little girl just hung her head. 

My heart sank. 

Just then, the little girl standing behind me, with the Elmo purse says, �Excuse me.�, and walks past me and up to the other little girl. Apparently, she too, heard what was said. 

Anyway, she walked up to the little girl and said, �My Daddy bought this for me, before the Army sent him overseas and he died too. He taught me to share, I want you to have it�, and handed her the little Elmo purse.

She then turned around, said, �Excuse me.� again and walk back to her mother, who hugged her and said, �That was nice thing to to do.� The little girl just smiled at her. 

The first little girl says, �Mommy look!!� With a big smile on her face. 
Her mother says, �Very nice, what do you say?� The little girl turns around and says, �Thank you.� Her mother lifted her head, and mouthed the words, �Thank you� to the second little girl. 

I almost started crying right there in line. 

The first mother and daughter paid for their stuff and left. I paid for my stuff and left as well. 

I sat in my car for about a half hour, just thinking about what I just witnessed. Just when I think humanity is at its lowest. It takes one little girl, with a little Elmo purse, to prove me wrong. 

Good job, little girl, good job!!!

My mom has a $100 bucks on her because she didn�t have change and didn�t know if her card had any money on it. So we paid for it and they told us that they didn�t have change for $100. The manger comes in and tells us it�s on him. It was so pure and soft. This just happened a few minutes ago. We said our thank you�s and left, they were so wholesome about it.",1
272,happy,This Valentine�s Day I wanted to do something for my grandpa but I couldn�t think of what to do. My grandpa had an Xbox 360 but no Xbox live so he was stuck on offline games so I went to my games and look through all the cases and found 13 days worth of gold cards. He was really happy. Me and him are about ready to play some games together,1

So I worked a caretaker in a summer camp during my summer break. It's for children from ages 6 up to 10. 
The little girl in question was one of the younger ones, probably around 7 or 8.
I watched over some children while they were painting and was talking to them, when a girl asked my how much I weigh. Children are more open to ask such questions, than adults are so I did not mind. 
,,65kg."" I said. 
The girl who asked said ,,I was at the doctor's yesterday and he said I weigh 23kg.""
A boy said ,, Mommy said I weigh 31kg."" 
A girl who'd listening to that looked really concerned. I asked her if she was ok and she said quietly ,,I weigh so much more than everyone else."" 
I tried to tell her that it didn't matter and she was still was a pretty girl and as long as she was healthy ect.... She was indeed a little chubby so I thought she weight maybe 10 kg more and was upset about that but I asked her just to be sure.
,, I got on the scale last evening and it said 400kg''. She didn't belive me when I said that must have overlooked a point on the scale, so I told her to go on the scale after school and really look for a point between the numbers, because that means she only weighs as much the numbers before the point (I didn't want to confuse her with decimal numbers). 
The next day she came up to me and said she found the point on the scale and that she only weights 40kg with a smile on her face.

I had to let my parents know but I didn't want to admit I'd wet my aunt and uncle's bed so I told them that I had a wet dream and we'll...you know. I'm pretty sure they knew I was lying but they just went along with it and let me maintain some of my dignity. Not sure why I'm posting this, I guess I just thought it was funny...",0
275,happy,"So, currently I'm a university student, but about 6 months ago i was working at a conveyancing company in the UK. I wont use any names so OL = Older Lady, the one on the other side of the phone, TC = Terrible Conveyancer, M = Conveyancers manager and Me = Well you guessed it, Me.

At the time I was working in the Identification Team and was working to help out people who needed to sort out there ID. I had a lot of clients that drained me and some people tried doing some seriously crazy stuff, when selling their house, or buying a new one. However, this is not one of those stories, this one is from my last day working there after my 2 weeks notice, so i was leaving and moving to London for university on the weekend. (Since being at uni I've been so busy that i don't 100% so I'm paraphrasing a little, but ill only put in parts i vividly remember).

So, the story begins towards the end of my last day, i had some jobs to do but when your phone rings that the biggest priority, so i picked up the phone and this is the following conversation:

OL (audably upset): Hello, I'm trying to sell my house, but TC has told me i need to sort out my ID.

Me: Okay miss, can i get your refrence number so i can load up your file.

She gave me the number and i start to search for her file, while loading the OL is audubly upset so while my slow as computer worked though finding the file I decided that since it was my last hour at my work and that this lady was upset to ask what was wrong, I'm glad i did.

Me: Miss, may i ask whats wrong? And if there is anything I could do to help?

OL: TC has been missing deadlines, wont pick up the phone when I call, and shouted at me when I didn't understand what we needed to get.

I cant prove that TC did shout at OL but in email correspondence between the two it seemed like the conveyancer didn't seem to be trying at all, and was being very unprofessional, so I decided to help.

Me: Sorry about the wait miss, I've just had a look over the file and it appears as though we need some documents from you. Would you mind if we go over everything we can do to get this sorted out for you, then, would you be happy to tell me everything about TC.

We were only supposed to have 5 minute calls with clients, but since it was my last day i had decided to take the extra time to help, it was my very last day, what are they gonna do? Fire me?

After explaining everything we needed to sort out the Identification i offered that OL send the documents to us, we will do all the work and send them back. Then we move to the second part of our call. (Which is where this story makes me smile).

Me: So miss, we've managed to sort out your ID, if you give me a moment i can raise a formal complaint against TC on your behalf.

Were not really the ones who were meant to write up complaints, we were supposed to get a manager and then the conveyancer to call back, but the lady literally couldn't stand talking to them. I take her statement and write it into a note on the file (That's how you added complaints). Then I emailed this to M and TC too.

Me: Miss, I've loaded that complaint against TC and I have notified M as well.

OL: Thank you so much for your help.

Me: Its no problem, if there's anything else I can do for you just ask and I'll do my best.

OL: Oh thank you! I was wondering when sale will be going though, I'm selling it for my children.

Me: No worries miss, I completely understand how stressful this can be

I looked up the date of the completion and give it to OL.

Me: Now the date I've given you isn't completely set, as the complaint would have to be processed against TC, as well as the documents needing to be delivered might take a few days, but that the date will be around there soon. If a week after the date I've given you the house has not been sold call this number: (M's number) and they will be able to help you.

OL: Thank you so much you've been such a great help!

Me: Have a great day, and i hope the sale goes though fine.

The call ended and i was 15 away from leaving for the day.",0
