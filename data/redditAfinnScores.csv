0,0,0sad,sad," to be honest i dont know what to do. My family is truly breaking me and this point.

my parents like to remind me that im the smart one. ill pay for their care when they are older so i have to get a good job but anytime i bring up something im always shot down. i dont understand or im giving them attitude. 

my little sister has stolen over £200 off me over the past 5 months and anytime i bring it up. all i get is well you shouldnt have left it around. my little sister hasnt done any school work for the past month over quarantine and  they expected me to tutor her while im in sixth form studing history law and business. when i said im busy they said too bad and you have to do it and when i told them she wouldnt listen to me they said they would take her phone. my mum says my dad will take it my dad doesnt as he said its her problem if she doesnt want to do her work. this is one situation of so many. 

all my family tells my parents that she is spoiled but they say she'll grow out of it. 

my big sister is a narcissist anytime something goes wrong she throws a temper tantrum. shes 24 with a kidand they try and fix what inconvenienced her. An example of this is that my parents already paid of her debt of over £2000 less then 8 months ago and now shes in bad debt again. 

my only escape from this family has been my nan and she just diagnosed with parkinsons. i honestly dont know what to do anymore i know that they're so toxic but their still my family amd as much as they have pit me through i do love all of them so much. Though i dont think i can survive here much longer cause i generally cant remember the last time i was happy and honestly i catch myself wanting to end it all too many time to count.",-2.0,-71.0,-75.0,-200.0,-15.0

Here goes: When I was 5, I was diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome, ADHD (combined type), OCD, ODD, and manic depression. 
I am now about to turn 30 (female, FYI). These past 5 years I’ve been doing a lot of therapy and research to understand, for the first time In my life, what ADHD actually looks like and how it effects me. I think the more I understand, the angrier I have become about it. I’m not so sure about ODD because I haven’t done any research into it, but I have recently done a lot of research on OCD and it made a lot of things make a lot of sense. At the same time, it’s made me realize what a cluster f*ck I am. Oh and manic depression is now known as bipolar, which I am not (guess it’s hard to tell when you are 5). My psychiatrist has given me new diagnoses of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder (in place of the manic depression/bipolar). Oh and how can I forget my complex PTSD? 
I spend the majority of my mental energy hating myself. No matter what I accomplish, I can never live up to my own expectations. And I’m always so angry that everything has to be twice as hard for me as it is for a neurotypical person.

16,16,16sad,sad,"Hi y'all.

So, first time posting in this subreddit and I'm not entirely sure if this is the right place, so feel free to redirect me to a more appropriate place.

Here is the problem: I turned 32 last friday and I usually take this occasion to give myself some time to think about the year gone by, my current feelings on things and evaluate future plans. While talking with my girlfriend about those topics, I noticed her bringing up some events - things that we experienced in our 10 year long relationship - that I had a hard time remembering. It wasn't just blurry, or some details were missing. I simply had no memory of it, neither vivid nor abstract.

By then I realized how often I had the problem of going along stories of my friends, especially those that directly revolve around, or include, me. It seems like everyone around me has some funny, insightfull or just interesting anecdotes to share, but I can't even connect to those memories on a very basic level so I just go along. Apart from some key moments in my life, a lot seems to be fuzzy, or just nonexistent. This doesn't just apply to events that happened way back, but very specific events that happened rather recently, especially with events revolving around my five year old daughter. If it weren't for pictures that I could reference, I'd be completely dumbfolded. The same applies to sports: I've been training and practizing Ninjutsu for 10 years, two times a week and I'm currently undergoing sort of a mentorship program for aspring trainers, but A LOT of the techniques I can do seem to stem from muscle memory alone. I often don't remember learning them and couldn't name them, even though we have a pretty systematic approach due to them being compiled by similarity in - literally - scrolls. No one of my peers seems to have that issue.

It seems this is getting worse, with more recent memories just fading much, much faster. There is no history of mental health issues, dementia or other neurological disorders in my family that I know of. I don't use drugs, don't take any medication and have a rather healthy lifestyle.  
Does anyone know of this or a similar issue? What approach should I take in order to treat, or get treatment, for this?

19,19,19sad,sad,"Thinking it might help to just try and put my feelings down in writing.

I work with a caseload of clients (members of the public) and have a fairly high level of responsibility over what I'm assisting them with. 

I am currently working from home due to Coronavirus which I'm finding difficult in itself , it's just hard to get on with things and get into a work mindset.

I have had a look at CBT and never really intensely tried it but I do know my problems are probably cognitive distortions. IE , my work audits go well, I was recently given a payrise as I'm no longer a ""trainee"" etc. I honestly suspect my colleagues think I'm competent and hard-working and are happy to help me when I need it.

However , I'm currently sat putting off contacting clients as I always worry about messing up or feel that they will be annoyed at me for whatever reason. Fundamentaly I feel quite nervous dealing with the public and meeting them in appointment / talking on the phone etc. I just wish I could be left alone and not have the personal responsibility! I don't know what causes this nervousness , I feel like I appear weird or that that I talk oddly or something! Maybe I am just lazy and like having nothing to do

I feel like I overthink things and sit for hours worrying about problems before taking action , I ask for a lot of reassurance and feel like I think of almost every ""what if scenario!"". In my 9 months in the job , nothing has wrong yet I should add. Although if anything does come out the blue and need dealing with it always frustratingly , one of the things I HADN'T worried about.

I feel that although I really believe in what I'm doing these issues are affecting my enjoyment of the job and I always feel tense and have butterflies In my stomach throughout the work week. If for example , a receptionist calls to put a client through to me I feel mild fear. I honestly don't know what I'm worried is going to happen. I worry that I've messed up something for the client or they're calling to complain or whatever.

I have a lot of abuse under my belt from my father and the only way I ever was able to maintain my sense of power and self was to doggedly argue and fight him. I was constantly berated, told I would be nothing, physically abused and molested. When I come under fire or perceive a threat to my esteem I react poorly. I have been better in the past but I think I'm not on top of my mental game lately.

I've been able to work through a lot of this but I feel now that I engage my wife when we argue or when I perceive her as being unfair to me like a freaking bear trap.

It doesn't even have to be something that matters, twice I have perceived her as having bad intentions or being unfair to me in the last week and instigated a fight with her.

Literally today I started a fight about her asking me to take a Zoom call on headphones, I decided she was being inconsiderate to ask me to do that because she takes her calls in central space and off of headphones (I'm usually asleep I work nights).

I'm 23 years old, I only have an older brother, who is a NEET, so all the respobilities is all on me. I'm the only one who is working, my dad is with another family. He sometimes visits us. My mom is living with my Grandmother and my Uncle. So basically, me and my brother are the only ones here in the house (w/c we only rent)

Here in our house, we have a barber shop and a small store. But ever since the pandemic, it got tough. Not a lot of customers coming to our shop/store. I always think how to pay the bills (rent, water, electricity, internet). Please keep in mind that my salary from working in a company is completely inadequate for the rent alone. 

I always lock myself in my own room, since I don't want to interact with my brother, since he's the type of guy who brags all the time without having any achievements (e.g. studied until high school only, no work, etc.)

I work as an assistant in a financing corporation.  I always do my best effort in interacting with clients, with coworkers. However, I always get scolded from other groups, telling me that I'm not doing my job right. There was one time that I literally cried for an hour in the restroom cubicle, because one of my coworker says that I always make the same mistakes. She always scolds me, only noticing the mistakes I made. She never notices the good things I did. 

In work, I never got the chance to know if I did a job well done, I always hear from my work that I always make mistakes. 

This week, I didn't get to report to my work. I have this feeling that I don't want to work, because I will interact with some coworkers, only getting bad vibes from them. At the same time, feeling sad because I can't get to help my other coworkers, making them to work double as to cover my absence. 

It also came to me if I should look for a new job, because the work I have now is pretty much not doing the best for me, especially my self esteem. Also, thinking if I quit, how can I pay the bills here in our house. I did thought of what if, I try to end my life. Thinking of it, I also think of the people who will be left, so it stops me from commiting it. 

Being alone here in my room makes me think a lot of things, I also cried while typing this post. Not sure if I need help, or am I just thinking things. 

I actually asked my friend if he thinks I have a mental illness or not, he told me that I'm just overthinking it and cheers me up that I can overcome this.

30,30,30sad,sad,"Hello there, i guess i'm just here because i just need to vent here but also want to know if anybody has any suggestions on how to cope with things or how they cope with similar things in a healthy way.

Anywho, lately i've been having a sense of dread like something or someone is out to get me and that something is going to happen soon. I feel like its a person or entity, not much of an event like a natural disaster although that is always a concern. I suppose the big reason why i'm writing this is because I felt ill suddenly one night; dizziness and difficulty balancing, nausea, difficulty concentrating, fatigue, that sort of thing. I looked into my water cup to find it a milky white and this send me swiftly moving to the kitchen sink to rinse it out. I noticed a white residue in the bottom, one that I swiftly washed away. Ever since then I've been afraid that what i'm consuming is somehow contaminated, mostly water I drink. Today was especially hard because even though it didn't look any different I felt like my water was somehow wrong and not the same. I couldn't pinpoint what I derived this from but I felt it in my core like it was a survival instinct. I felt like I couldn't tell my parents, however and I didn't know why but, yet again, I just felt it intensely in my being. I haven't drank water all day and i'm now afraid to take my medication in fear that it is also contaminated with something. All I can think of in my head is a white mucus or film and pale white hands brushing against me, whispering to me in languages unknown to any mortal being but in a way that I know i understand deep down somewhere. I don't know, i'm just confused right now. Physically I feel fine but mentally I feel like i'm being watched and assessed and that if i fall asleep I won't wake up.  I feel like I can't tell if noises are laughter or crying and it scares the heck out of me and I want to understand whatever is there reaching for me with its dozens of clammy hands and mouths. I don't know, I just need to get this out there. I have a past with psychotic symptoms and anxiety and depression and such things have lead me to the hospital twice and I don't want to go back because i just can't relive things i've seen and heard there without having another dance with trauma.

31,31,31sad,sad,"Every time I start dating someone and I become emotionally invested and attached, I get very anxious and panic. Thoughts of infidelity and not being good enough flood my mind. If he’s taking a while to respond to me, I’ll panic and think he’s talking to some other girl or he doesn’t want to talk to me. In the beginning it’s usually manageable and I can talk it out with my partner but it gets worse and worse as time moves on. I don’t know why these thoughts fester my mind. They haven’t done anything, that I know of, that has given me a reason to doubt them. There’s this part of me that wants to be the best of the best in their eyes: better than all their exes and previous partners. This includes personality, physical attractiveness, career, etc. The physical attractiveness is usually the one I’m most concerned about. I have some assumptions as to why I feel this way. I am riddled with negative thoughts about my appearance. I don’t like how I look and don’t really consider my self an attractive person. That’s (my face) not something I can change about myself. There’s this constant thought of not being enough for them and because of that maybe they’ll stray because I’m not enough for them to stay. Maybe if I’m the best, they’ll actually try to keep me… I know no one’s perfect and it’s not exactly possible to be the best at everything… but I can’t seem to get those thoughts out of my mind. Usually at the 2-3 month mark, it gets so bad to the point where I panic because I don’t think they’re interested in me as much anymore or I’ll nitpick at the things they say about me and make it out to be an attack on my appearance or just me in general. I’ll end this out of nowhere and without hesitation because I just want to stop feeling that way…. and maybe they’ll step forward and show me that they actually want me. This time around, I notice that my hand tremors have gotten more noticeable. I should’ve caught on that I’m more anxious than normal instead of dismissing it. When they don’t step up and “let things end”, I feel personally attacked and go into a spiral. I make myself the victim of the narrative because them just agreeing to me being “too sensitive for the relationship” or any other lame excuse I give, means that they personally think that way and that I’m too much for them to handle… I’m unwanted again… 

I have been cheated on and sexually assaulted in the past and that has a big influence on how I act now but I don’t know how to through this cycle of anxiety and panic…",-2.0,-204.0,-30.0,0.0,-45.0
32,32,32sad,sad,"I (17F) have been living with a family friend(FF) and my mother for about 2 years now. Only recently, since quarantine started, have I become so uncomfortable with her I can barely handle being in the same room as her. 

She thinks I'm really irresponsible because I don't do my chores, but in reality I can't bring myself to do them when she's around. I got the vibe that she already dislikes me, which caused me to distance myself and not talk as much.
Pretty sure this has caused FF to dislike me even more till the point where she sometimes just glares at me.

This led to me becoming more and more uncomfortable around her to the point where I will only go downstairs to eat when she's not around and that I am now too uncomfortable to even go downstairs to leave the house. I know that when I go downstairs and she's there, I have to say something, but firstly I have no idea what to say to her and secondly I feel like whatever I say she's going to snap at me. Usually I end up just chickening out whenever I have to be in her presence and keep quiet, hoping she doesnt say anything to me as I dash past her. 

I've talked to my mother about this and she just says ""just get over it, you have to get over it"", but I don't know how. Can someone give me some advice on how I can handle this situation?

Events that led up to the point: 

An extremely stressful morning of package handling (a package being signed and delivered to someone who was not me, and only half of another package coming in). The morning was full of stress and tears. 

After a couple hours of sleep my partner and I were having a discussion about why things were happening, and some comments were said that caused me to run away from the conversation very distraught and crying. (I have a history of self harm and two suicide attempts very recently). 

I was about to cut myself when my partner stopped me and hugged me, apologizing and talking to me. During the time my partner was talking to me I completely couldn't move. It felt like I wasn't even there in the room. I could feel myself semi present in my mind, but not in my body. I've never experienced this before and I didn't know what to do. I was still crying the whole time but not functioning any other way except for blinking. 

When I finally did come back I was very scared and backed away from my partner. I was trying to back away from the situation because of how scared and confused I was. After coming back I cried very hard and was shaking quite a lot in my legs.

I've been trying to get on SSI for a year now and I have no other income. I've tried to work but I sincerely just can't do it. Even 9 hours a week total was seriously pushing it for me. And that's not enough to live off of on minimum wage. But I can't survive without money.
I feel so alone and alienated. I don't understand people. I don't understand why money keeps me and so many other people like me from the basic things we need. Housing, food, water, clothing. It's kept from us unless we can pay and keep the pockets of some rich bastard fat and happy.

I moved in with some long time friends across the country and instead of finding stability like they'd said I learned one of them is an offending pedophile and the other is an emotionally abusive stalker. I came back to my hometown and was only able to afford it from the stimulus check and selling a lot of my stuff. I was stuck there for 8 months total and spent the last half of them in constant terror, genuinely fearing for my life.

I don't have family that support me. I'm trans and gay, and I ran away from an abusive home when I was 19. Even if I tried to come back to them to beg for help my life would get worse.

I had been planning for half a year now to move into public housing with my partner. Because that's been my dream. To make a family, have that sort of stability and belonging that I've never had. The application came in the mail. My partners abusive grandmother had previously said she would pay for his plane ticket here, and reimburse him for some other things. Since the application came in she's been flip flopping on paying it and now yesterday she's decided that instead of paying to get him to move here, she'll pay his way through college, something he had never expressed interest in. He's in the same boat as me, wanting to try to get on SSI. I've seen him struggle with working. I've seen him struggle just in general. 

She isn't offering this out of kindness or a desire to educate him, she's doing it for the same reason she's been flip flopping. I know exactly how she is. Both of us do but he's just... Accepting it and I don't understand. She wants to keep him under her control. That's all it is. If she was genuinely interested in furthering his education, and he was genuinely interested in pursuing it, there's no reason he wouldn't be able to go to college here, in a college town, in a state much better and a town much better than where he is. He'd be locked there for at least four years. But he said he kind of wants to do it, and that it doesn't matter if she backs down. This doesn't make any sense to me anymore. Nothing does. But why should I be surprised anymore, because this is always how shit goes for me. I have been trying so hard to get his paperwork settled and to save up money for him to come since she refused to pay, we have been planning this for half a year. And now it's just not happening.

It started when I was talking to this dude- on of the first guys if not the first that I’ve ever romantically talked to (I’m closeted). Things were wonderful and we had such good relationship by my situation and distance made us end it.

Then multiple times they expressed continued sexual interest me. They don’t express interest in a relationship, just sexual. It hurt. It hurts. I’m seeing them next week with friends. Idk how to navigate it.

It’s not just this dude. It’s a lot of stuff. I never thought of myself as attractive until I got to university and started getting catcalled and got stalked around a gym.

I knew there were many philosophers who discussed some dark stuff, but I paid little attention. However, in the past 4 months I've fallen into this rabbit hole of philosophical pessimism, anti-natalism, misanthropy, and pro-extinction movements. After reading this stuff my world view suffered dramatically.

Every day I feel anxious and angry that I am alive. I keep having dark thoughts that my sentience is a burden and my parents were cruel and selfish for having me. Just the other day I saw some children playing outside with their parents. Something as innocent as that to me felt evil because their parents subjected their children to unimaginable amounts of pain and suffering without their consent. I felt the best thing to do was to hope the family had a quick and painless death all at once to spare them from suffering. After that, I felt my chest tighten and my feet went cold. That feeling has been periodically coming and going the past week.

When I write that this is a feedback loop, I mean it in the sense that I feel a strong compulsion to keep reading these ideas even though I am aware of how much pain they're causing me. I canceled plans because I was reading Ligotti's ""Conspiracy Against the Human Race"" which put me into a state was almost like a breakdown but not quite; yet I couldn't stop reading.

The psychosis side of things has calmed down quite significantly due to medication but my depression and anxiety flare up all the time.

On Monday I had a bad flare up with my depression. I’d been alone for the majority of the day (live with mum and brother) and I was bored, like to the point it was really getting me down, sounds stupid I know.. like why not just do something? Well there was nothing to do, I don’t have friends, my boyfriend was out with his friends and I had no motivation to do anything anyway, that’s when the bad thoughts started creeping in.

So it got to about 7pm and at this point I’d had enough of being on my own, feeling worthless, nobody to talk to and the thing that overtook my thoughts the most was to take an OD. I’ve had this thought many many times before but I’ve never acted on it but that night I was soo close. I started crying uncontrollably and couldn’t think of anything else apart from to hurt myself, so started punching myself in the head. Better than killing myself right?

My boyfriend came over that night and soothed me until I fell asleep.

I am sorry for all negativity as described below. There are also a lot of beautiful moments in our household, but in this post I am mainly venting and describing the negative aspects.

My boyfriend and I want to move out into an apartment for ourselves. We live in a dysfunctional household with my brothers and one parent. We have been actively searching for a place for the last 7 months, but it’s extremely hard to find a place as a starter without paying a ridiculously amount of money. We’ve been to two house viewings but every time we’re the third or fifth in line or so. Finding a new place is definitely getting closer, and I know we will find a nice home eventually, but I feel like it is taking too long.  I feel like I am utterly powerless. We apply for like 20 places every week and it is exhausting. I frustrate myself daily about all horrible aspects of our household: the mess everywhere,  no one cleans their own shit, my brothers who live completely in their own word (severe mental health problems), my father who wants to move on with his life and  girlfriend but cannot do that due to many reasons.. the atmosphere is often terrible and I wouldn’t even call it a ‘household’.

I love my family and if I could I would fix their problems, but unfortunately I cannot. I have enough things I’m struggling with myself. I just want to move on with my lovely boyfriend and keep a greater distance to everyone else’s shit and depressing moods. I’ve had various breakdowns the last few months (especially due to quarantaine). I know once I move it I am never moving in again in the house I grew up in. So I try to make the most of the time left living in this house. I am  sure the connection between me and my brothers/father will become better once we have our own place. But I just don’t want to wait any longer. It is so exhausting to go to the house viewings, becoming really excited for the nice place and hopefull again, and then not being the candidate to have the home assigned to.

So I (20F) have this weird i guess habit, I’m not sure what to call it, where if thoughts about something I regret or feel guilty about in the past memories start playing then the only way to stop them is by saying out loud “I want to kill myself” to stop them. To be clear I don want to harm myself currently but I did at some point in my life. Lucky I got myself out of that darkness but I have this now weird habit. The images of the regrettable memory or traumatic memory literally don’t stop and just grow with negative emotion unless I say that phase. Idk what it is much less explain it without sounding weird. I want to definitely explain it to some one professionally but I’m terrified they’ll say that I do want to somehow harm myself and that’s not the case. I just hate that sometimes the memory show up out of no where but are a bit constant and I usually have to deal it the emotions until I say the phase.

78,78,78sad,sad,"Hi redditors,

I (f 30) feel like I'm losing my sanity in my current relationship with my bf (28) of a little over 2 years.

I am highly emotional and he has depression and, I and his brother suspect, some narcissistic tendencies. We moved in together last fall and all hell broke lose. We both had trouble adjusting and all expectations fell short. I ended up going to therapy because I felt my emotions were the root of all trouble and I discovered a lot about myself and about how to control my emotions, although of course it's a work in progress. 

I have since started journaling to further explore where emotional overreactions may stem from and what situations trigger me. I feel much more balanced and more often than not am able to put negative mindsets aside in order to focus on healing and passion in my life. 

My bf struggles very hard to recognize the progress I am making and is extremely sensitive  - understandably - to situations that have led me to ""explode"" in the past. In his eyes, I'm a monster who's responsible for ruining his life, he starts attacking me as a ""prevantative measure"" and claims he ""was right about my all along"" should I react poorly to him calling me names, telling me I was retarded and didn't deserve to be loved etc. 

Since Corona started he has been admittedly extra sensitive due to the restrictions, but he still claims every little spat is my fault, interpretes everything I do as an attack on him and tells me I deserve to be treated this way for being such a horrible human being. Anything nice I do for him, any affection I show him becomes worthless in his eyes, because eventually we will start fighting again, which makes me ""a liar for being nice to him even though I visciously wanted to make his life miserable"".

Lately I'm noticing some aggression from my side towards him when he attacks me for having feelings and belitteling me. He doesn't recognize that his behaviour is part of this vicious cycle where we emotionally abuse each other and every day it's getting more difficult to detach myself from these feelings of aggression. Today I even slapped him after he called me a name, and even though we had a calm conversation after and I know both sides were extremely aggressive, I feel horrible for not being able to control myself.

My ressources for stabilizing my mental health seem to be failing at the moment and I wonder if anybody might share some wisdom from similar experiences?

And this got me thinking about how I've been approaching this year in general.

It's been a tough year both worldly and personally and I have been making very solid attempts at being more happy with myself and moving up in life. I've been going through each day like it's simply just a stepping stone onto the next, and I haven't made attempts to make myself comfortable in the moment. Sleeping isn't a time to relax anymore, it's a process I need to get through in order to reach tomorrow. 

I feel like I can't experience comfort as the things which used to give my head comfort now just give me stress and what will perhaps give me peace of mind in the future, I currently don't posses.

So I don't know. I don't miss what used to give me peace of mind as it was ultimately negative, but now I'm left in a strange transition spot in my life and I'm just jumping from one day to the next. Sorry if this

For example, my brother was late to dinner with my family tonight. This slightly upset my mother, which in turn greatly upset me. My mom was able to drop it but I wasn’t, even though I tried.

I spent the rest of the night upset and was not talkative, it made the dinner less pleasant than it could’ve been and I might as well not have even been there. I feel bad but it’s almost that my emotions are out of control.

This is one example but this always happens, once I start feeling upset or negative it seems like the thoughts are a one-way train with no breaks. I tried to excuse myself, take some deep breaths and I recognized that I don’t need to feel this way and my emotions are a choice, but it didn’t change my mood, it never does.

84,84,84sad,sad,"I’ve always doubted myself and relied on my friends/SO’s to help me through my tough times. I developed this habit through my parents divorce 4-6 years ago (it took 2 years for the whole process). With quarantine and not being around my friends and being home from university, I haven’t talked to my friends from school all that much. My friends from high school are here, but I wasn’t (and still not) close enough to talk about my issues with them. I never really was in with the group, so I relied on my SO’s.

My SO broke up with me about 2 weeks ago, and I just feel so empty now. I still talk to them everyday because they said they’d would still want to be friends (they weren’t in the right mental space, and I was too dependent) and I’d rather not lose my best friend as well as my SO. So I’ve been trying to not talk about my problems, and without them or being around my friends from school, I just feel so alone. I have a full time job over the summer, but it’s WFH and I’m alone the entire workday, and then I usually just stay in my room the rest of the day. 

Although they said I can always come to them if I need help, I’m not going to burden my ex like that. I still love them so much, and I’d never want to hurt them by adding to their problems. This makes me feel stuck because I feel like I don’t have anyone to talk about my problems with. I won’t tell my parents about my problems because my sister has some mental health problems, and they’re worried about her, and I don’t want my parents to be worried about me.

All of this loneliness combined with the person I love not even having feelings (they’re trying to suppress their feelings until they’re gone, and they already are/almost gone) makes me feel empty. I feel like I never win in life. I always lose. I thought about killing myself about 5 (ish?) years ago: I laid on my side in the bath tub and said whichever side I fall on is what happens. Now, I know I can’t kill my self. It’s selfish, rude, un-empathetic, I’m too much of a coward to do it, and it’d crush my sister, parents, and my ex. I’m also scared to die, there’s too much that’s unknown and I hate not knowing things.

I’ve scheduled an appointment with a therapist, but it’s in a week, and I want to improve myself because I very well know that I need to. I just really don’t want to be here right now. I want to just vanish in a Thanos snap, and then come back when everything is better. I’m sorry for the rant, it was probably a waste of your time to read it.

Today was mentally the hardest days ive gone through. Ever. Nothing particularly bad happened. I was just lost in my mind. I just worked at a job i hate. Ive been recently having thoughts like ""what am i living for? I have no purpose and no one needs me."" and today those kind of thoughts were overwhelming. I was very short tempered , i didnt care. Before i left work i just left it a mess and clocked out. This was obviously careless and now with a clear head i feel bad for leaving like that. I just wanted to go home and hide under the blankets. Living feels like a chore to me. I recently lost both of my dogs due to my living situation. For a long time i would tell myself i live for them. Because they needed me. Something needed me. I loved them so much. I dont really have friends, i have a roommate whos really important to me but hes out of town a lot and i dont want to stress him . So when hes out of town, i seem to explode. and i dont like burdening my family especially when ive been told my mental problems aren't that bad. Im aware that im not homeless or starving but everyday still hurts inside my head. I always leave it inside, my feelings, because i dont see them as important anymore. 

When i got home i just laid in bed and sobbed quietly. I cant even describe the feeling. I just shut down after a bit. Laying there lifelessly. Then i had the urge to get into the bathtub. With my clothes on and warm warm water. It felt nice. I felt so cold and then so warm. I was in a trance, and these thoughts did not stop. I kept thinking about how tired i was and how i had no one to call , no one to turn to. Ive had several friends leave me because im too much for them. Another reason why I hold everything in. Venting made me lose important people. While in the tub i thought of those no longer in my life. I thought about what our last memory would be together. I wondered if theyd care if i turned up dead. I let the water go over my face and in a weird way, i felt at peace. I stayed under for a bit, the water spilled over and i didnt care. 

I then remembered that i had called my dad earlier that day, and that he might come over. I immediately sat up and started crying uncontrollably over the thought of my dad finding my body there. I remember not calling my mom for help because she was mad at me. I had to remember that even if i felt alone, my parents do love me unconditionally. In a way my dad pulled me out of that trance. I remembered my roommate too, how he'd have to deal with that. I felt so weird and i couldnt stop crying. 

I eventually got out of the tub, changed into dry clothes. I didnt feel that much better though. My roommate called to see how i was doing. One thing i love about him is how he checks up on me. I didnt tell him everything often but i did talk to him. He listened and let me cry a little and talked to me the best he could. I know its hard for people, and him, to give advice on touchy subjects like that but what matters most to me is that he was there and he tried. He was busy but called me a few times throughout the day to make sure i was okay. 

I also went to my mom's. Made a few comments that raised concern and made my mom cry. I didnt mean to, i usually stay quiet about these things because my mom tends to blame herself and i dont want her to do that. I don't want to be the cause of her unhappiness just because im unhappy. I know she loves me, i know my dad loves me, i know my roommate cares about me. Eveb if its just three people , thats okay right? That's enough. Im just so scared of being alone. I dont know where i was going with this post. I originally wanted to know why i did what i did. Why did i want to be in the tub? I wasnt intentionally thinking about suicide , but like i said-- i went into this like trance i just didnt care and i wanted it to stop. I don't think i wanted to kill myself, but that felt close, the closest ive ever been and im so scared of myself. 

I just don't know what to do now. I feel better- not cured but okay. I feel okay. Im proud of myself for making it through today. Im here and i did it. 

Comments, questions, resources and advice are all welcome. Again i think i wanted to vent or just tell my story. Maybe understand why i had that urge to be underwater. I don't know. ",-1.0,-236.0,-172.0,-314.0,-90.0

Growing up I was a little chubby and shy, which lead to me being treated like shit and being bullied all the way till graduation. My family is toxic and value money over real relationships.

I have been alone my entire life and only had some distant friends here and there, no one close and no dating experience. I had no hobbies or interest for the first 18 years of my life. I would come home play video games go on YouTube rinse repeat for 19 years. I have probably gone out to hang out with people maybe 10 times my entire life. 

I am so fucking lonely and just want friends and a girlfriend for a wholesome relationship. I was in a suicidal depression from ages 14 to 19 and didn't tell a single person and no one knows still. my entire life I have tried to be a kind respectful person to everyone I meet, I have probably met about 5 genuine kind people my entire life. Everyone seems so superficial and fake. I try to be a good person but life keeps kicking me down.

Around February 2020 I knew that if I didn't change my life I would kill myself sooner rather than later. So I got my license and started going to the gym, and finally found some hobbies that look interesting such as cooking, rock climbing at the gym, and volunteering at an animal shelter.

Then the stupid Chinese government became responsible for a worldwide pandemic and here in the U.S our government has been handling it like a brain dead sack of potatoes left to rot in a dumpster. Just like that I couldn't go the gym, couldn't go to college to meet friends, couldn't go rock climbing, couldn't volunteer at an animal shelter, couldn't apply for a job. that's it fucking nothing. 

Of course recently lockdowns have been reducing, I can go the gym at least but still can't rock climb, can't volunteer either, can't go to college online classes fucking blow, can't date anyone since meeting people irl is a no go and please don't suggest superficial fake af online dating. Although surprisingly after like 2 days of job searching I am already hired at a cool fun place that looks like it has some chill coworkers to make friends with.

But for me, this still isn't fast enough. I want everything open so I can have a normal life and actually be happy for once in 5 years. Ik it's selfish to want everything to open and risk millions of deaths. But you know what else is selfish? forcing millions to stay at home without paying bills, increased loneliness and mental illness, increased domestic abuse, increased divorce rates, increased suicide rates etc etc.

I want to be a therapist since ik exactly what it feels like to be in the most miserable state possible, to feel like nothing will ever be okay and that you could never be happy. I beat my depression all by myself but Ik not everyone can, so the if I can help others struggling with that, I could find peace.

I keep hearing people say it isn't about you, it's about our contributed effort for everyone, for society and others etc etc. But let me ask this, why the fuck should I care about others when almost everyone I have interacted with life has been horrible? Why should I give a shit about the people who made my life miserable? who never helped me or cared? 

I know obviously not every person is bad but what else am I supposed to think and feel when this has been my experience. The way others have treated me in my life has left me jaded and wary of others who may not deserve it. All of a sudden I'm supposed to help and stop my own happiness and progress just so other people can be healthy? The same people who treated me life shit my whole life? Sorry but I couldn't care less. 

I know this is pretty unhealthy but seriously I can't in any way mentally accept all of this for ""the betterment of everyone"".",0.0,-270.0,-162.0,-400.0,-285.0
92,92,92sad,sad,"I don't have a single happy memory from when i was younger apart from a ""clip"" of me playing in the snow when i was 4 years old. every memory after that up until i was 8 years old is just filled with abuse and violence from my mother.

Things didn't improve much when i lived with my father, he frequently left me to fend for myself so he could either sell drugs or have sex with women. I practically raised myself until i was 11. At this point my mother coaxed me into returning to her and my little half-sister, under the guise that she had changed and was no longer an abusive person. Obviously that was a lie, and within 2 weeks of being back the abuse started. I was cooking and cleaning, getting my little sister ready for primary school. Hell the only thing she did was sleep on the couch.  I had my friends around a lot and in the end she accused them of molesting my little sister. I still believe to this day that she did that because she wanted to sleep from 4pm-6pm and the noise we made stopped that from happening.

Eventually my aunt got involved and told me to live with her and i did. Although once i lived with her it was great, holidays every year and just a nice household. About 2 years in my mother threw accusations that i tried to kill my sister and that i molested her. My entire family got involved and it turned out that my sisters father was a convicted pedophile and put a knife to my mothers throat back in the day. So it transcribed that she was just throwing the same experiences about to effectively bend the truth to whatever situation she could. My entire family black-sheeped her and she was literally forgotten about.

Now although no one believed her, my mental health has just been destroyed, my confidence with dealing with children has really messed up to the point where i feel like can't interact with them because in the back of my mind i think people think i'm a pedophile when i'm most definitely not. This has caused a rift between my godson and my little 2nd cousins which i regard as my nephews. Although i want to be stupid, silly and all loving but this mental wall is just stopping me from doing this. In fact, i find it very difficult to love anyone, it's like i lack the functionality feel that emotion at all.

My sister has tried to contact me on multiple occasions but since she still regularly speaks to my mother, even though shes been sectioned on more than one occasion, i don't trust her or what she has been manipulated to believe by my mother. My family have expressed concerns about her intentions and strongly believe i should not interact with her at all, although one day if i have children i would love her to be an auntie to them, so long as my mother is kept far away and even in the dark.

I think I've rambled on a lot and need to ask the question, can you ever mentally heal from a complete lack of love? has this forever messed me up and i'm never going to be happy or even be able to fully love another human being? People will say get help, but then i'll need a therapist and opening up about this to other people, in real life is scary. Another aspect its almost like i'm like my mother if i have server mental health issues and i never want to be like her. Also I've never opened up to my family about how i feel every single day and i don't want them to judge me, and think i'm a freak, like my mother. ",-2.0,-178.0,-52.0,-100.0,-165.0

I'm floating in the void inside my own head, and as I sit here I can't find the words to explain everything. I'm currently between therapists, I was receiving free therapy from my school that I just graduated from, so I have no one to go to and I can't find anyone to dump this on.

Since moving home my social life has taken a nose dive with all my friends moving on with their lives. I had to go back to school for a certification which was a two years program so i threw myself at it with full force (bad undergrad GPA put me immediately on academic probation) and i never bothered making new friends or trying to find a relationship, which is another can of worms. Right before COVID began I was telling myself that this year I was going to change things. I wanted to change, find new people, a partner, a new life I could make my own. The teacher job market looked promising, my grades were stellar, I had lost a great amount of weight and was feeling amazing. Now everything feels like its fallen apart. I can't stand another year at home, I feel stuck here and unable to change. I cant justify moving because I only have like $25,000 saved up and it just doesn't feel like enough to try and start a life with.

95,95,95sad,sad,"Hi, im 19f. I’m not having hallucinations (as far as I’m concerned, however the doctor in charge of my mental health care is aware and is monitoring the situation). I don’t think they’re hallucinations as much as delusions and paranoia. Reflections will move and change slightly, become warped etc. I’ll see things very vividly in my peripheral vision. I get really strong feelings of uneasiness, being watched, having something near me, of creatures waiting for me around corners and chasing me through the house and trying to get at me when I close my eyes. When things are bad, I’ll think there’s a little girl standing next to my bed and I’ll talk to her. She doesn’t talk back and I can’t see her, I just really really believe that she’s there. At the moment, I can’t be in my bedroom at night.

I just wanted to have a quick rant about the thoughts I've been having lately.

I've been having a really rough week, like really rough. And basically I feel so damm lonely! I'm lonely yet I have a family and a friend, and a boyfriend.

My boyfriend is really understanding and he's been great. I lived with him last year and it was lovely and when I had a bad time there he'd always be so good at helping me lift out of it. Yet now I'm at home and because of covid I don't see him often at all. And it's been like a punch in the stomach.

A punch in the stomach at the realisation that my family are there for me but they don't understand my pain. My boyfriend does to an extent but I can't keep calling him so upset and then ruining his mood and his day and not to mention that he now feels he can't share his hurt with me.

Even when I speak to people there's nothing they can do is there. Let's be real, this is all in my own head and I don't know why it's took so long to realise but omg I have to deal with this all by myself. Noone else can make the anxiety go away, no matter how many nice things they say or how calm they try and make me.

Noone can put my life back together for me and it sucks. It sucks that I'm battling this horrible illness, or these illnesses and appart from the times of happiness with others, when I'm in pain then it's all down to me.

This makes me so angry at my mind, at my life and at everything in general to be honest. It's not fair. I didn't do anything wrong.

To start off, I have anxiety and depression and have been diagnosed for about 4 months.

\- I have a **stutter/ stammer** and have done since as long as I can remember. It's not severe but I feel it hold me back massively in all avenues of my life (Socially, dating, professional). Recently I've developed massive **anxiety** because of it; I overthink simple social gatherings with friends I've known for a long time, I am absolutely petrified of going on dates with girls and struggle with things that could possibly get me further in life.

\- I can't **concentrate** on things for a long time unless it's Netflix, Youtube, Instagram etc. I try to limit how much time I spend on these platforms as It's in the consciousness of society now that consuming too much of these things is obviously bad for you. But I used to be so ambitious and determined to put in the work that would make my life better but I find myself just wasting time and procrastinating on things so much.

\- My **discipline** has dwindled. This may link in to the previous paragraph but I've noticed I just have no discipline anymore. I never go to bed on time as my free time is very limited but it bites me in the ass the next day as I'm exhausted and work 12 hour days at work. I never sit down and do anything productive anymore as I find it mind-numbingly boring.

\- I've recently feel like I have had an **existential crisis.** My 27th birthday is 3 weeks away and I'm petrified of it as I work a mediocre job that is going no where even though I have so many things I want to do and accomplish in my life but I feel I am held back by the above. I don't know what my purpose is anymore. I used to want to be rich and constantly thought about it all the time but now I feel like it's an impossible thing to achieve with such a low rate of success and, again, the above holds me back somewhat.

\- This may not be relevant or could be extremely relevant but I also **drink and take drugs**. I feel it's necessary to mention this for obvious reasons. I would say I drink every week, some nights it's literally a beer after work at home, sometimes I do go out with friends and I end up drinking a lot and taking cocaine with my friends, not a huge amount (half a gram max) and I do it maybe once every 2 weeks - a month. I find coke makes me depressed the next day (common) as well. I know it's easy to say ""say no"" or ""you're hanging out with the wrong people"" but I've reluctantly been taking it semi-regularly for around 5 years now and when you're drunk it is so hard to say no, it's like my body sniffs the line for me without me being able to control it and after wards I'm left to think about the ""decision"" I've made, furthermore due to my stutter I don't feel like i can go out and just make new friends easily. I mentioned this in case anyone else has had a similar experience with long term drug use and can offer advice on this.

108,108,108sad,sad,"I have grown up as the only child in a toxic household. My dad is an alcoholic, and my mother didn't really do anything about it, and generally just disregarded the seriousness of the issue. But overall is a good mother.

My dad drank every night, more or less, with 3/4 nights going out to drink. From the ages of 11-16 I would stay up late to make sure when he came home there was no arguing. My school work suffered, I never had enough sleep, and this is where my anxiety stems from.There were nights where my parents would argue, he was never physically abuse but has broken items in the house. Definitley emotionally abusive. I don't know if I am ready to write about specific events. 

By the age of 14 I could not eat the days I knew he was going out, I would throw up if I heard them raise their voices, and I strarted self harming. I have had this anxiety feeling since, I went to the doctors around this time and was told ""it would pass"". I felt sick every single morning, physically sick say 30% of mornings. School didn't take it seriously even though I went to the doctors a lot. My mother only half took it seriously. I had to have my own room for my GCSE exams, my invigilator opened a can on coke and the sound it made just made me panic, mid exam. 

My dad bought his own house around the time I was 16 and started to stay there if he went out, which wasn't as often as before. Whilst I would still worry, I knew I don't have to stay up to make sure he comes in and doesn't argue. This was also the age I began drinking with friends, and had fun for the most part.

I moved out at 19 for university and loved having my own safe space, and enjoyed drinking at the start. I started taking antidepressants before my second year of university. I now have a month left at my student house before I have to move back with my parents, and have finished university.

For the past year I have found I can't handle alcohol, I will drink some, but I can't enjoy myself like I used to, and I feel this has been a long time coming. I have drunk less and less on nights out and try to leave early, or if I can not go out at all. 

I have been worried about my parents since the beginning of lockdown, if my dad would drink, would they argue? Would I be able to go and resolve it? Would I finally resort to calling the police? What would the aftermath of that be like? 

And now last night my housemate had two friends down, so them three and me and my boyfriend joined in. They played drinking games and I drank when I found it physically hard to. I was worried about being a miserable person in general and ruining the fun but I really did try. It got too much in the end and they were shouting and creating a lot of banging. One banged on the door as I was in the toilet and it just brought back memories and I broke down. I just don't want to see alcohol anymore.

A while ago, my doctor suggested I may have agoraphobia and he put me on zoloft. The first few weeks were great, it felt like I was finally getting better. It didn't work as well for a little bit after that, and so I asked for my mom to call in and up the dosage. It helped a little, and it eventually stopped doing anything. My doctor said I should go to therapy but it never happened. 

A few months after that initial doctor's appointment, me and my mom were fighting and she ended up calling me crazy because she 'needed to take me to the doctors for being too nervous'. And after that, I just stopped trying to reach out for help. I always think about it. And maybe she didn't mean it, maybe she said it in the heat of the moment, but it hurt me a lot. It made me feel horrible, especially with all I went through to try and get help in the first place.

My anxiety has been getting worse, I can't talk to people I'm not close to without feeling like the wind is getting knocked out of me. My presentation anxiety used to be bad, but it's gotten even worse. I can't speak in front of a group without nearly crying or having a whole panic attack. And even when it's not in front of a group, when I talk about my feelings aloud, even for a small portion of the conversation, I'll just burst out into tears and I have no idea what the hell is going on. I could feel fine in the moment but appear to be 'In a mood' and if one of my parents asks if I'm okay, I just feel like I'm going to start sobbing in front of them.

I've been having trouble taking my medicine anymore, and I've been self harming. Usually it's only a couple of times every few weeks when everything bubbles over and I want to hurt myself, but it gets even worse on my period. I'll stay in bed and hardly take care of myself and I'll just lay here and feel horrible and think about what it would be like if I could off myself. I've never made plans, but whenever I get too stressed out, I always find myself looking up painless ways to go, just incase I can't take it anymore.

It feels like everything is just a mess, and I don't know what to do. My sister used to have extreme mental health problems, but she never told our parents, and I feel like if I try to keep getting help, it'd just be really unfair. She deserved help too but she didn't get it when she needed it most and that makes me feel so fucking horrible.

I'm over 25, suffering from agoraphobia and, things leading to another, living with my parents with no job. I'm not making much progress because I fear pain and basically have no motivation to do anything causing me pain. Finding love recently has pushed me to see a hypnotherapist and I've made baby improvements, but I unfortunately have bad reflexes of sadness, self-loathing and basically doing nothing when I'm feeling bad.

However, my parents are worried and upset and recently decided to enforce rules for me for my own good (like waking up at a certain time, doing chores, etc.)

Unfortunately, this resulted in me feeling really disappointed and angry at them. I said that I expected them to be kind and helpful instead of punishing, but they simply answered that being kind did nothing and that they're not punishing but helping. According to online ressources, taking your child's things away and giving them consequences when they act in a way you disapprove is legit education, but as someone in a child position, I find it hard to swallow, haha. I am of course aware that it is their home and that I have to submit, but I feel that trust has been broken between us.

This has at least motivated me to try and find a job (so that I can leave lol), and some of my friends are ready to motivate and help me in a positive way. I will start CBT very soon to see if the therapist can help me get any motivation.

Does anyone have tips to motivate me to work on my phobia and on my life in general? Is there an alternative I can suggest to my parents instead of them ""helping"" with childish rules? (Or am I an entitled brat for imagining my parents owe me anything?)",-1.0,-133.0,-45.0,0.0,-45.0

When the pandemic hit, my freelance project went poof, I’ve got no any client at all. I’ve try to register on platform like fiverr ,workana, etc but I didn’t get any reply. Now that things are slowly shifting back to “normal” where businesses slowly open up again in my country I was hopeful, yet I still got no reply no matter how many job I applied. I just need a temporary job until I can pursue my degree this September as a mature student. 

I feel like I’m doing nothing. Like I’m waiting for time to pass. I feel guilty that my boyfriend is covering up our rent and my dad still occasionally send me money because he knew I’m not surviving. I can’t even get a job like as a waitress. 

I feel like I should be like getting my shit together at this age (25F). Sorry for the vent. I just feel awful and wanted to let it out. I will do my best to keep looking for job.

I’ve had a poor sense of self image for most of my life (history of self harm, body dysmorphia, and eating disorders).

I just want everything to end. I don't know what to do anymore. I want to keep going for my best friend (the one that is never home), but it doesn't seem worth it.

123,123,123sad,sad,"Wow! It turned out to be a long and lengthy rant! Please go through it and tell me how you interpret it. So please go through it, it will be highly appreciated and don't get deterred by the length. Thanks.

I had this account created some 6 months back but it stayed there, just like that. Idk what drove me to reddit these past few days, 6 days to be precise. Came across this sub the very first day and it intrigued me. Never thought that it's a possibility. I faced the horns of dilemma these past few days, drowning in memes and ghost stories, but this sub remained, never ready to say what I should have long ago. But now, I am here, at last.

What are abusive parents actually? I had gone through many a incidents of users facing abuse at the hands of their parents which I never thought possible for a parent. Those are only there for the movies, I thought. A broken child, growing up to be a person of its own. A true surviving story. But here I found many survivors. Am I one? After all movies are based on real lives.

Where do I begin! As far as my memory goes, my parents were very good and loving to me but I was mainly brought up by my grandma. There isn't much that I remember from that period. But I faintly remember an incident, I think it is from my 1st grade. It was the day of the parents teachers meeting along with the distribution of the report cards. I remember father had taken me to school and the teacher had spoken in lengths with him. He looked sombre once we left school school, not saying a word on the return journey but I was okay (didn't understand what results meant as such I guess). On return, I saw my father and mom getting together and speaking in hushed tones that somehow made me afraid, may be the vibes they were giving out. So remember running to my grandma. She stayed with us till her death. But going there later. So, I run into her arms afraid, almost at the verge of tears and ask her, what was wrong? She wouldn't say anything but smiled and gave me candies instead and told me while I was having them, now the thing removed from mind, that my report card was colourful! I didn't get it that time but was happy that it might be something good then. But soon, hell broke lose, as my father marched into her room and grabbing me by my arm, dragged me to my parent's room and locked the door! He then took off his belt and started hitting me with it. I don't remember the pain anymore, just remember grandma's face through the window, crying and asking him to stop. I have no memory of it from there and never asked anybody about it. Apparently I had failed my 1st grade, so my report card was marked with red.

I don't know what changed, but I became a good student from then on. Good in class and at home. Results improved, I mean I was getting almost full marks in every subject till I was in the 4th grade. Now coming to my parents, they were good all along this period! Remember occasional thrashing for my antiques, but it never bothered me that much. My father took interest in my studies and would task and test me from time to time. I never gave room for complaints.

But a thing that stood out, all through my school life, even in high school, was that it was my grandma who prepared my breakfast, my tiffin, getting me ready and everything while my parents slept. I had early morning school, starting from 7.15 in the morning. Till fourth grade my father used to drop me but then I used to take my bike and go. So when I left, it was just my grandma who would see me off. It still stayed with me and it doesn't sit well with me, idk why!

Growing up, I soon started going out on my own to the playground, parks to play with my friends after school, or be it basketball practice at school but everybody knew about the rule I had! My father returned from work (he was an engineer working for the government) at around 6-6.30 in the evening and I can't be out after that. So each day no matter where I was, I had to return home by 6. On the occasions (there were a few, growing in number as older I got) I wasn't home, I was not allowed in on return and has to wait outside the closed doors for sometimes hours (2 and half hour being the longest if I remember correctly) till someone, mostly my grandma forced my father to open the door.

Then I had the study routine, I had to sit down to study by 7 or else a round of either shouting or a few slaps here and there. And God save me if I dozed off studying! But nothing was a surprise as a cousin of mine used to get beaten up for getting 95 out of 100 cause someone got more than her ( her father is a gem, but I even feared her mother).

Time goes on and I go from class to class, year to year, more of less the same thing. But the thrashing or shouting reduced drastically again due to my grandma, who made my father understand that now I am grown up and shouldn't be treated so. Somehow it struck a chord with my father.

My mother all along was somewhat non existent, she too feared my father but he wasn't abusive towards any other person. Never drank, had no bad habits, but still he was this raging fireball towards me. My mother on the other hand never stopped him but would emotionally manipulate me, into doing what they thought best for me. (Now I come to think of it as emotional manipulation, god this subreddit helped me a lot). 

Hitting puberty is a time when there's need for guidance and being the only child had no one. I was sent to a boy's only school, a missionary one. So never came across girls much and it was discouraged even at home (though not directly). So naturally it made me nervous around girls. At this time I came across a girl in an extra class taken at our teachers house. She was beautiful and almost immediately I fell for her. But had no guts even to talk to her and moreover she was Muslim (a big no no in our family). So controlled my urges and thinking about everything, never approached her, not even a hi was exchanged! (She is a good friend of my now and I told her everything but it was too late, as she got married, but that's for another account! I even wrote a letter in blood, stupid teenager, huh!)

I did well in my 10th standard and decided to go ahead with science (my father wanted me to be an engineer, just like him!) and went ahead with it. But somehow I didn't find it interesting. I failed in a couple of subjects in the first term, but soon I put all my efforts in and recovered. But in my senior year I meet this girl and things changed!

I now had started growing a mind of my own (I know it was high time) so when I met this girl (from the neighborhood) I again fell head over heels for her but this time the only difference was, I approached her. Soon we became good friends, chatting over the new phone I got. She was a Muslim too, but this time something had changed in me and I dared. Friendship grew into something special but before it could go ahead anymore, somehow my father came to know about her! (I didn't tell my parents, or even my friends as I didn't want to end it prematurely. I wasn't prepared tbh) Anyways my father engaged me in a conversation about her. I played safe by neither accepting or denying, leaving it open to interpretation. That mad him even more mad but this time I got no thrashing but for a few days my existence was ignored! I was cool with that but what followed, I wasn't prepared for it.

I still remember quite vividly! It was a Sunday evening, winter had just set in and the air had lost its moisture but became chilly. I and my GF, were strolling around a park away from both our places ( she too hadn't told about me), when suddenly out of the blue, a car started honking just behind us. I turned to curse but only to find our car and father driving it. I was forced to get in, leaving her alone ( I won't forget that day, the look on her face, the last look I got of her) to get back home. 
I was taken back immediately and grinding began, this time both my parents! They accused her of being Muslim (as if it mattered) then going on to call her names, till being called a prostitute. I broke down at first then burst out, tearing my shirt as the buttons went flying in every direction, but at that moment a hard and tight slap rang across my face! It was my father, who hit me again after 4-5years! I couldn't take it anymore and left home. I went to the park but she was gone. Her phone has been switched off when I tried calling her. I got tensed!

For the night I went to my best friend's place and told him everything, about her to the events of that day. I asked him not tell my parents if they asked (they surely will visit, I knew). Nothing happened that day or the next. I had skipped school and contemplated my next moves. I tried calling her but again her phone was off! It frustrated me the whole day. I even thought of returning home and go to her place to sort out but I controlled that urge.

With nightfall came my father (my friend's parents had forced him into a betrayal, kid you not, it did feel like it then) and with him the news that my parents had visited my now ex-GF's house to talk her parents out of it so that their daughter doesn't meet me! Now I knew what the switched off phone meant! They knew I wouldn't budge, so they took the matter into their own hands. And everything was lost for me. 

My studies suffered, my mental health too took a toll (all this I am understanding now, at that time I was made to believe that these were side effects of puberty). I wasn't left alone, father started accompanying me to school and mother on the return. I somehow grew distant with my parents this time. 

Soon school life was over and I took tests to get into an Engineering College. (I wasn't sure then, but my parents wanted the legacy to go on). All these years my grandma was always there to support me, my only lifeline that kept me sane.

Now I got the opportunity to go away. It was back in 2006. I left my parents place and took an apartment in the city where my college was, some 150 miles from my parent's place. It was kind of a relief, I'll not lie! I started studying and enjoying my college life. Met, a girl in the 2nd year and everything was going well. But she opened me to art and performance art! I was always a movie buff but now I knew what I wanted to be and it wasn't an engineer! I would talk to my father on a daily basis almost ( understand, I didn't know anything how felt then) but somehow my father started changing. His change started soon after the GF fiasco. But still he was my father.

Now when everything is great my mother wanted to drop in and stay with me for a few months (apparently she missed me but I only missed my grandma, who blessed me when I left) and so she did but soon events take a turn for the sour as I was no longer the kid that left my home town, but somewhat of an independent thinker. Soon we started to clash and it was my turn to burst out but each time I did, she would break into tears, feigning a stroke (sometimes when things went out of hand) and we both lost mental peace. It went on like this for over an year ( she must have thought with time I would again change, but this time they were in for a surprise) but I didn't budge (I had broken up with this girl friend again because mom didn't like her and I don't know how it crept in to our relation, driving us apart) it was her this time she had to leave. And she left and never asked to return, thank god! 

By now I had stopped going to college and started studying about films and filmmaking on my own. And one day out of the blue I dropped out of engineering, pursue a career in film making. Surprisingly my father didn't say much but left it to me to decide, just stating the pros and cons. But for my mother now all hell broke loose. She tried every trick in her bag to get me back to engineering but this time I didn't budge. I sought out filmmakers and started assisting them, first as intern then gradually moving up the ranks. It was in 2010.

My father now seems more approachable than my mother, as she continues to discourage, even till today, using her emotional tactics. Father now gets pissed at her for this attitude but she still does. I would visit them on a bi-monthly visit, mainly to see my grandma, who was happy for me.

In 2017 my grandma died and every attachment I had to the place died with her. Never gone back since and never saw my mother too. But we sometimes talk on the phone. I meet my father every month and he is a totally different person now. But my mother still keeps nagging, the new one being, to get married! Which I will not in the near future.

I will be 33 this July 16th and now have a stable girlfriend of 7 years+, have a few movies behind me, mainly writing and assisting. My own documentaries, ads, short films and an IMDB page with 15 credits to my name.

Idk if I was raised by abusers, still now not able to judge them, so those who went through my lengthy piece be the judge and tell me. What happened to me?",-1.0,-407.0,-380.0,-257.0,-495.0

I’ve always until back in 2015 felt like a monster because everyone, including family, made it very obvious that I wasn’t human.... and thus didn’t deserve to be treated like a normal person..... I just..... was a tool, a fixture, a resource, and a verbal punching bag....

Then in 2015 I realized that even characters in shows and games that are portrayed as monsters can be loved so...... where did that leave me?

Nothing..... I guess

And....... the guy I dated before my current ex-gf kinda broke me and I..... I was truly done with dating.... and then a year later she came into my life....

She was amazing, and I......... I felt so numb for so long and then one day I just..... starting truly feeling the love I had for her.... before I felt numb but I could still tell I loved her it just..... felt extremely distant...

And then, Monday, she.... she stopped saying “I love you” back out of nowhere... she stopped calling me Babe..... and with my history of relationships I.... I started to get severe anxiety (diagnosed with situational anxiety) so yesterday (Tuesday) I asked her what was wrong and.......... and the issues boil down to that she cares about me...... that I embody everything that she could ever want in a SO....... but she can’t imagine me with her when she imagines the future.......

And........ truly........ I have been in so many relationships where the person says that they don’t love me....... but they just......... want to stay in that relationship?..... I..... I am ugly, there is no way around it..... so when I started I... I felt actually loved for the first time and......

And I guess I just......... don’t know how to process my sadness... she just................ 

It feels that the world wants to make sure I knows i do not deserve to be loved in any way shape of form... when I’m a temp, when I’m a forced date, when I’m a crutch, when I’m a rebound, when I’m a literal joke, when I’m a expected fixture, and.... and when I even have the chance of being actually loved and cared for.... and I’m....

125,125,125sad,sad,"It’s so cool that after 2 years of hard work in therapy and working on myself, I’ve been able to develop the tools I need to navigate everyday life. I don’t have anxiety anymore, I’m typically not depressed, and I’m doing such a good job navigating life. However, certain events in life set me off and I’m forced to face the reality that I do have a mental illness. 

Example: I got into an argument with my brother last weekend when I was visiting my parents. I erupted into a severe panic attack, my first one in ages, and I fell into a deep depression for days, and had an alcohol relapse. My parents had to come to my house and drag me out of bed. I was hysterical. I hadn’t cleaned my house in days. I hadn’t slept. Work was unbearable. I couldn’t focus on basic tasks. 

I’m so proud of all of the progress I’ve made and that I’ve learned to navigate every day life and get out of bed in the morning, which is something I struggled with for such a long time. I’ve come such a long way and that’s great, but it’s so scary when one seemingly minor event reminds me that I do have anxiety and depression. What hurts is that I manage it so well that I forget I have it. That’s what makes the episodes of strong uncontrollable emotion so hurtful to me. I never see it coming because I forget that part of me exists. 

Then, I inevitably have to spend a week or two focusing extra hard on mindfulness, exercise, checking in with my therapist, and managing my diet to make sure that I can recover properly. Because once I’m down, getting back up is work. I have intense flashbacks of whatever caused me stress, I don’t sleep well, and I can’t stop replaying the events in my head. 

Coming back is nice, but at the same time I hate the glaring reminder that navigating life is a bit tougher for me. I wish that weren’t the case. My family is always very concerned for me and I never understand why. But, the more i see my pattern develop, I understand why they worry. It’s because no matter how long I keep it together, they inevitably have to come scrape me off the floor at least twice a year. It sucks that I put that burden on my parents.",-2.0,-168.0,-30.0,-21.0,-60.0

When I was a child, my mother try to teach me four languages. It was a good choice she made. We had to move many times. Speaking four language help me a lot. I can speak four languages but not all fluent.  I have a hard time to remember words and grammar. It is even for my native language. Sometimes I say the right word then mess up. It is hard for me to always remember. I can read English very well. I can not write or speak English well. This is a problem sometimes when I speak of my mental health.

It has been very hard talking about mental health. Many people do not understand what I am try to say. It means I have to repeat myself many times. I try to write my mental health but people do not understand that too. It is very hard to talk. My best friend understand what I am saying a lot. But she does not understand all of the time.

If I speak in my native language it is hard too. Many words are lost in my mind. It is hard to speak it sometimes. There are many words in English that I do not know in Cambodian, Chinese, or Jarai. There are some words I do not know in English. People say to use Google to translate but the translates do not always make it right. Sometimes the words are not equal or make sense. My mental health is worse by the languages. I would want to forget one language to be better in another. 

When I am sad I hurt myself. I do not think I do it in the bad way. When I hurt myself I pinch my arm. Sometimes my arm gets a bruise or it gets blooded. I do not do this all of the time. I only do this if I am very sad. A lot of the time I cry and sleep. I sleep many days for a long time.

 I live in a small town. People are mean to me for many reasons. I do not look like the people in the town. My voice is different. It is hard for me to speak. My brain is different. I do not understand what a lot of people do. I do not feel romance or sex the same way. People think I am a freak for being a boy who is not wanting sex. People say mean things about me because I have not kissed a girl. I do not need to kiss a girl for people to be nice to me. 

It was very hard moving to America. I did not get to say goodbye to my friends. Many people of my family do not live here. I do not think I will ever see my friends or my family again. That make me sad. I think about them a lot. To think about them makes me cry. I cry every night for them. When I google it said I have depression. That feels okay for me. It said many other things too. Anxiety. Post traumatic stress disorder. It said I may have the ADHD and OCD. I do not know if I have any of it. It said to talk to a doctor about them. I do not think I can go to the doctor. My mom does not have extra money. She provide all things for us now. 

It is difficult to know many people will not understand me. It is sad that many people will not learn or help me learn that way we can be friends. I want good friends in my life. I love the friends I have but they do not always understand. They support me always. But they do not know my hard life. Many thing happened that I do not like to talk about. It hurts me too much to speak. I want to get help but I do not think I can. That is okay. I will still live. My mom would be very sad if I did die. I can not make her sad. I will live for her and the many nice people I know. I will live for my neighbor that I like very much. Not in a romance way. I like her as a friend I think. She is very kind. I like kind people.

The first day of class, the teacher was reading out our names from the sheet to take attendance, and he said my given name. I politely asked him not to call me by that, and to avoid confusion with the bully, to call us by our last names or number us. He ignored my request, and said that he would just call me by my given name as it was written on the sheet. After this interaction, for reasons I do not understand, this bully would shout my given name from across the room, with no provocation, at any time when the teacher wasn't directly talking to the class. Every day. Of every week. Over. And over. And over. Again. I couldn't tell the teacher to make him stop, since his apathy was the inciting event. I was afraid to tell anyone else (counselors, parents, etc) about it, because I was afraid they would think I was overreacting.

134,134,134sad,sad,"So for the past 6 months i’ve been lashing out randomly for small things that go wrong, or if someone says/does something to irritate me, i go OFF. i’ve never had problems with anger or lashing out. shortly i turned 11, i was diagnosed with pretty bad depression, epilepsy, and a couple other health issues. i started feeling very depressed and emotions id never felt before. lonely, miserable, sad, , hopeless and thinking about death/suicide a lot. then i was put on medications to treat other health issues with side effects being depression even though i already had it. all my emotions felt amplified no matter what i was feeling. this was during summer before entering middle school. my parents were putting me in one where i knew nobody. school was the last thing on my mind. i was too depressed and miserable to care, thus leading to never make friends in middle school and failing classes. this continued all throughout middle school until i switched to online for most of high school. i attended freshman year but it was too much for me. i did however make 2 amazing friends and we’re still super close. so for years i was terribly depressed with no emotional outlet other than family who claimed i was just being dramatic and missed out on having friends, parties, going out, and normal stuff teens do. i was at home in bed either crying or playing video games to distract me from my issues. i’m 17 now and i haven’t been depressed for almost 2 years. it feels so good. i was in mental pain for so long i almost didn’t want to seek help. depression became my security blanket. leaving would mean i’d have to enter the real world and couldn’t just stay in my little toxic bubble. all this led to very low self esteem that i’ve been gradually rebuilding over years and getting better but lately i’ve suddenly been lashing out once or twice a month over everything. and now with this whole pandemic i’m trapped inside all day and im scared to return to where i used to be. i feel like i could explode with rage and break thing sometimes. is this anger from built up repression for years just now surfacing due to my depression and missing out on middle school and high school life? other than that ive been “normal”. what should i do? thanks for listening to me rant haha",-1.0,-260.0,-157.0,-321.0,-75.0

Every day I wanted to die and when I wake up, I feel disappointed because I'm still alive.  But then I told myself that nothing will change if I'm not gonna step forward so I made a letter and sent it to the girl I love.

Ever since I was a child, I'm not good at opening up to other people, and yesterday I just steeled myself and open up to the girl I love. She said that I need to learn how to love myself before I can love others because if not, then there will be more problems coming into my life and she also said that I should not rush it and I need to change for myself and not for others (God I really love her).

After that, I had a deep reflection on myself. I always think that people secretly hate me and that I constantly feel that I'm just a burden for everybody. If a person doesn't reply to me I will tend to think that person dislikes me or I might have done something stupid that makes them hate me. I also think that people are talking to me because they are just being kind or they are bored and don't have someone to talk to.

After 4 years of not wanting to hurt myself anymore... I finally really want to start self harming again.
I want to feel the pain again so I can feel something.

I thought about cutting my thigh with my knife, but resorted to hitting my knee instead.
I'm so depressed and lonely... only 17. I have no one I can talk to.

My parents don't understand the full extent of my depression and Bipolar 2 disorder. They believe it's alright to leave an emotionally unstable depressed person by themselves and make it feel like it's their fault their depressed. 

I cant talk to my mom about any of it because she is so double sided on my mental health. She'll act all sweet one moment when I'm having a breakdown and then the next breakdown she's harsh. 

I cant take it any longer, I just want consistancy in people. I want a happy life. I want some reassurance in my family, but my life has become miserable and lonely. For the last hour the only thing I've been able to feel is the tight squeezing of the heartache in my chest. It makes my finger numb. I was sure I was going to end up having a heart attack.

I've been strong for so long... but everyone just sees me as weak. They think that back when I was pretending to be happy I was strong, even though that was when i was the weakest. I feel so alone. My thoughts are all over the place and it feels as though I'm just venting now... but I yearn so much for someone to call me strong or to acknowledge my hardships and see that I am trying... and not that I'm just some shitty little brat.

I dont want to hurt myself... to see bruises or scars. But I dont know what to do. It gives me a high, if only for a moment. Please help.",-2.0,-141.0,-97.0,-300.0,-30.0

148,148,148sad,sad,"Example, being told “You’re not entitled to sex” starts to feel like “You’re not worthy of sex”.

Being a 24 year old virgin, it really feels like a reinforcement of “never gonna happen, unless you pay a sex worker, at least”.

And what about love? Can’t buy that. What if I CAN get one, but not both together?

I’ve been told “You’re ugly as fuck” and other similar things by so many back in grade school, and by literally hundreds online. This is what makes it really feel like confirmation that I’m unfuckable, and unlovable. 

I hear too many mixed and contradicting opinions online, like “Embrace being single and celibate”, “Just wait for it to happen one day” (waste even more youth), “Get chemically castrated or on something to kill your libido” (I can’t help but feel that this might actually make me feel even worse? And it just sounds unhealthy. But if I have to be a “cuck” it’d be better if I could at least not care about it, right?), and of course “Just pay for it.”

I almost fell into inceldom, a group that claimed to be non-hateful incels (which was bs). They were just telling me to accept my fate, and making me further believe that I am somehow universally unattractive to the female race on a genetic level (that’s not possible, right?)

I’ve been told that I’m not entitled to ANYTHING. But food, shelter, healthcare, etc. Seem to at least be debatable, since you will literally die without them. This bothers me less, since I’ve never had to go without any of these and had them provided to me/accessible my whole life, but I could lose all that at any time too. 

The existence of real life 30-40+ year old virgins feels like reinforcement that I’ll be joining them if I’ve still never been able fi do it, because my life up until this point, points to their direction.

The existence of virgins losing it in their late 20s (older than me, but still in 20s) is KIND OF HOPEFUL, but that doesn’t prove I’ll be like them either.

Just waiting for life to happen seems like justification to not put in any effort, or maybe I’m misinterpreting that because I’m so sheltered and inexperienced at life and take things so literal.

Say I DO lose it within the next few years, or even this week (LOL, just an example, no way that’d happen, especially with the you know what virus going on), and me and her end up in a serious relationship. I don’t see it lasting, because I’ll constantly feel inferior (especially if she’s had multiple sexual partners before me) and wander about what I missed out on, sex with multiple partners, what that variety is like, before settling with one to be seriously together with.

I honestly see myself looking up and shooting the birds (my fingers) and yelling “TAKE THAT GOD/UNIVERSE/WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU ARE! FUCK YOUR PLAN FOR ME TO BE A LONELY VIRGIN! I TOOK CONTROL AWAY FROM YOU! IT’S MY LIFE MOTHERFUCKER! GO THROW A FUCKING FIT ABOUT IT! MY FATE MY CHOICE MOTHERFUCKER!!!!” and laughing like a hysterical maniac, after losing it. 

It’d be a victory against forces higher than me. But a lot of people’s contradictions about God or whatever have probably corrupted my view about God too, if there even is a God.

I know, I sound crazy. Just goes to show how ridiculous the concept of God, or the interpretation of God can be. No good God would send us to “Hell” for not believing in him without providing reason/proof to believe in Him....",-2.0,-212.0,-57.0,-100.0,-75.0

158,158,158sad,sad,"This is a long one.
I (17m) have been friends with a girl (Let's call her N, her username starts with an n, all letters are based off usernames,) since I was 10 years old and she was 11. I've been through a lot with her, helping each other with our depressions and encouraging each other, she was always there for me, and I felt like we would be like this forever. 

Now, N is severely mentally ill. She grew up in an abusive and neglectful home, and felt like fictitious worlds and characters were the only constant in her life. She began to have dreams of interacting with them, and felt like they were her only friends. She believes that the person she is in the dreams (A shape shifting dragon who protects characters from their creators, she made up a whole world around it) is the ""real"" her and her actual body outside the dreams is merely a shell for it. 

It's gotten to the point where she cannot watch TV or play games due to feeling too connected to their characters, and grows depressed from nobody believing her. I only know this because she knew me long enough to trust me with it, she thinks I believe it's real, and honestly, I probably deserve this for not doing more to release her from it, but seeing how she firmly believed in it and refused to listen to anyone who says otherwise, I didn't feel like I had a choice.

N does lots of online roleplaying with her characters, and always has. I used to, but later only really did it to support her. An older friend of hers (P) who she (according to P) cut off all contact with after she didn't believe her dreams were real, reached out to her, and gave her a discord invite, wanting to get back in touch with her and saying that she missed roleplaying with her. I was interested and joined too. Now there were lots of people here, but the most important I'll call K and C. K was 19 when N was 17, and right off the bat relentlessly hit on her, and made explicit comments about her to her in private messages. She put up with this because she felt flattered by the attention. C has anxiety and didn't like K. Most of us didn't, but we were too scared to say anything because of how close he was to P. 

I for one always felt incredibly anxious there, and I was in a really bad place, right off the bat K hated my guts and saw me as a rival, I hated how he would talk about N, in front of everyone no less, and, after N invited me to a new server she made for close friends, walked in on them basically being really sexual before she nuked the server and apologised to me in dms. They had a big fight and N left the server, not because of K's sexual harassment of her, (which she apparently vented about to other female users in pms, according to C) but because he insulted her characters after he figured out she thought it was real. K also exploited her longing for the lover she has in her dream worlds. K got mad at me and accused me of turning everyone against him, we fought, and P banned me. 

N started a new server for the friends she made on the old one, including C and myself, and we bonded, I really felt a deep connection to them all. P also apologised for K's actions and started a new roleplay server. 

Now, it's a bit of an open secret that N is mentally ill. She takes the roleplay super seriously, and gets upset when people don't like her characters. And so, everyone else's characters practically worshipped the character that was meant to be her, and it got annoying to me after a while. C felt the same way, so we talked in pms. I'm an absolute asshole for doing this, but we complained about N a lot. Turns out she led C to a mental breakdown over her getting tired of playing a character she liked, but C never told anyone. So N never knew. We complained about how her characters could do no wrong, how I felt like she didn't care about me anymore, and all the times C felt like she was pressuring her to always be online and hold up to her expectations. Sometimes I felt like we were going too far, but kept it to myself for the most part. 

I felt bad for C, so I talked to N about it in pms. She got super depressed and scared that the others were scared of her, and were gonna leave her. I did my best to help her. Later in a voice chat C's stream cut out and N said things like: ""Hey C!"" ""You there?"" ""Miss you!"" In text. I was worried C might take that the wrong way, so I told her to please stop.

Seeing how sad she was, not talking for about a day after that, I felt extremely guilty, and was offline for a few days. I came back today, and saw that N had vented. A few days ago. Saying I had pushed her into believing everyone hated her and was going to leave. C tried to defend me, saying I was stressed, and then she replied (copied to the best of my memory.)

N: ""Stressed about what?"" ""Making me cry myself to sleep?"" Leading me to catastrophize for days on end?"" ""(My name), we were supposed to be friends, you're not my father.""

I'm fucking tired. I'm fucking tired. I'm fucking tired. 
I'm tired of my head and I want out. I'm a psycho and I'm aware of the road of loneliness I'm headed down.

But god damn is it better than being constantly lied to. Constantly told theres still better out there. Constantly told I'm not a motivated individual even though it's impossible to build something with only my heart involved.

I'm tired of being told I'm the one that's supposed to lead. I'm fucking tired of being told I'm the one that's supposed to be a man but then getting asked for space in return.

I'm tired of putting my emotions on the table only to not find out about someone 2 years down the road.

I'm tired of being told I can depend on family yet they are the one who bashed my head in and sent me to the hospital

I'm tired of being monogamous and finding out your fiance with 2 kids of 7 years admits shes polyamorous and when the new girl comes into my life 6 months down the road, she promised she was different but told me 2 years ago she was polyamorous. Then I tried for a year and she kicked me out homeless right before the coronavirus.

I get run out of everyone's lives so fast and obviously its because my mental health, but fuck. Governments got to get rid of the stigma of ""oh ask for help"" because what in the fuck does it do but have people tell you that it's going to be ok and then just dissapear? Lol. Where's the friends I drove around for free all those years in highschool. Now that I'm homeless none of them show up lol

Wheres my friends when i constantly put their well being before mine? Wheres my friends when i paid for whatever they wanted without asking to be repaid?

Wheres my friend i once drove to woodstock during college because he missed his mom? Oh and drove home without asking for gas money and went back a week later to pick him up.

Why am I always told I should stop being me so I can stop being depressed? How about some of you show compassion like you all say you do in all these fucking statuses of world events you all seem to seem ""worthy of a profile picture banner""

I was told by someone that I shouldnt be upset no one came to my aid because you dont know their situation.
Yeh I do get that, but shit there are some of you on here I really really thought I'd at least get a message from by now.

Why can’t I (19F) just have fun with something intellectually challenging without taking it so personally? 

I just came home from an escape room with my sister (13F). She seemed to have some fun, but for the most part, I was frustrated out of my mind. By the end, I wanted to hurt her and the staff. Badly.

This happens every time. My sister seems to love them, and dad (40M) emotionally pressures me into going with her since it requires at least two people. 

My sister lives with my egg donor, and she only visits periodically. I try to treat her as well as I possibly can in the limited amount of time we spend together, but I’m very short with her in escape rooms, and I feel like I’m part of the reason why she gets so stressed out in them, too—my bad mood has a history of being rather contagious.

For some reason, these things make me so quick to anger. Before I ever went into an escape room, I thought it would be something fun and a little challenging. My intelligence is something
I’m very proud of, and it’s helped me to face many obstacles with confidence. 

I endured a lot of abuse when I was younger that was mainly psychological in nature, so in order to push back and survive, I needed to outsmart many people, many of which were considerably older and more powerful than me, so I consider my brain to be no joke. I feel like there’s almost no challenge I can’t face in that sense. 

But escape rooms? For some embarrassing reason, I just can’t handle them. I can’t handle the idea of being stumped so badly (and while other people are watching, no less).

At the end of every escape room, one of the staff will come into the room with you and show you how it’s done if (when) you don’t escape. And every single time, it’s only makes me more upset. Either parts of the puzzle are so easy that I feel like an idiot for not figuring them out, or they’re so complex that I can’t comprehend how ANYONE could solve them. It makes me angry at myself and everyone else in equal measure. 

The most horrible part is that being unable to solve escape room puzzles totally depletes my self-esteem. It’s like my brain is screaming at me, “Why can’t you do this? Why are you so stupid? It’s probably the weed. It’s make you a moron, now. It’s too late. Your brain is worthless. You might as well die. How are you going to navigate the most basic aspects of adulthood if you can’t even do this? You’re a pathetic, worthless piece of shit. People lied to you when they said you were smart; they wanted to lead you into a false sense of security. You can’t even be nice to your sister in a wittle escape room? Aww, does baby want her bottle? Your identity is a lie. You’re not smart. You’re a failure.”

And these thoughts are so “loud” that I can’t block them out, and they make me fall into a spiral of depression and fury so strong that I can’t even describe it much further than that.

Now, I’m completely exhausted, my face feels hot to the touch, and I want to kill myself. Again.

I want to enjoy this. Every time she and I have gone to one of these things, I try to force myself to have fun and to not get too emotionally invested, but I can’t. I end up thinking so poorly of myself that I contemplate finding a way to commit suicide right there in the room. 

The anger that I feel... It’s stronger than my own body. I lose everything about myself except for the anger. And I feel so helpless because I can’t channel it into anything healthy when I’m trapped in a room full of confusing puzzles with a ticking timer. 

I don’t know how to feel better right now... I’m so tired that I don’t even have the strength to eat. Tying this was a little hard, too, but I had to get this off my chest. I feel miserable—nihilistic, even. I’m regretting everything I’ve ever done in life, and wondering if I’ll ever be able to properly navigate adulthood if I can’t even keep my emotions in check.

168,168,168sad,sad,"Hi friends, 

This is a throwaway account and I’ve never talked to anyone about this, but it’s something that still affects me deeply, years after the fact. I’m mostly just looking for reassurance, if not a “name” for what happened. It wasn’t rape, as I didn’t say no or very clearly withdraw consent. But I wanted to super often.

Basically, from high school to early college I was in a relationship with a boy for whom I had to do a lot of emotional labor, before I knew what that was. He had a hard home life and was remarkably well-adjusted considering, but I always felt like more of a safety blanket than a truly valued partner. 

Important context is that I was a very shy teenager. I still struggle to stick up for myself in one-on-one relationships, but I’ve gotten much better since. He often ignored boundaries I tried to gently set, like personal space, staying past when I wanted him to leave, etc. I always felt incredibly guilty for that. I value personal space, and I’d always have to ask him 3-4 times “when are you thinking of heading out?” “I should get to bed” etc. before he’d even consider leaving. Even when I’d have panic attacks and desperately needed space, he’d say “I don’t understand why my being here isn’t helping.” It took A LOT for me to even stick up for myself, and when I did he’d just argue and ignore it.

I didn’t know what to tell him, and I internalized a lot of that by thinking I just wasn’t a very giving girlfriend. But I slowly started to resent spending time with him/being on close proximity to him because of it. Even when we’d be sleeping in the same bed, he’d grab at my chest and just pull me in in a semi-sexual way when I was absolutely not into it. I began physically recoiling from him as instinct, and I still have issues when my current boyfriend touches my chest. 

Anyway, the sex began to feel very one-sided, and being the shy teen I was, I didn’t know how to say anything, and I very much felt like it was me being a dysfunctional partner if I didn’t commit to regular sex. Here’s the important part: I don’t remember a time I ever said “no” and he continued sex. But SO often he’d grab me or do something much smaller and I’d have to say “stop” multiple times before he’d stop. There were boundary and consent issues, but it didn’t feel that serious at the time because it was little things like touching me too much or grabbing at me when I tried to pull away. My mind didn’t really register that as bad, but my body definitely did. 

We both had a very hard time communicating about deeply emotional/intimate stuff - which I don’t believe was entirely our faults, as we were young and fairly shy. So we didn’t talk about sex. It just became something I decided to endure. I have very vivid memories of just laying there, my face turned away, just clenching my jaw and waiting for him to be done. I’d try to hide some of the discomfort - but another part of me is still grappling with WHY he didn’t see that I was uncomfortable/in pain/ just enduring. He had to have known to some degree. I’d sometimes cry after sex because it felt so intimately violating. He’d hold me. But it all felt very retroactive, like he’d continue to do it and handle the fallout afterward. Idk. 

After a while this became normal for me, and there were a couple times where he’d bend me over (so my face was sort of hidden - that was a consensual position) and I’d start to panic so much that tears would be streaming down my face, but I told myself “you just need to let him finish.” Of course, when he saw that I was crying he’d feel bad & hold me. But we wouldn’t really talk about it. I felt totally unable to bring it up. 

All of this, coupled with the fact that he cheated on me in a very out-of-left-field, gaslight-y, painful way the year prior fed into the panic and silencing I felt. 

But again, I never verbally withdrew consent. 

About a year after we broke up, though, I started having pretty dramatic flashbacks and panic attacks, all centered around sex and feeling totally out of control of my own body. It’s still with me to this day - about 5 years after the fact, and it’s become a regular problem in my new relationship (with a really lovely, open partner). I panic and cry a lot during sex. I hate it. I hate him, honestly, and I wish I could make this go away. I hate that it feels like he still has some level of control over my body. 

But, he has no idea. He doesn’t know he ever did anything wrong by me, let alone that I’m dealing with this trauma years out. Haven’t spoken to him in years. And even though I hate him when this stuff comes back up, I do believe he’s a good guy and I wish him well. It’s hard to explain. He really just doesn’t know.

Basically, I’m really struggling with how to identify and address this, because I can’t even justify my feelings to myself. It wasn’t rape, it likely wasn’t assault because I didn’t feel confident enough to communicate or withdraw consent (I still don’t know if I WOULD have if I knew how - I felt such a responsibility to just get it done and over with). It’s a lot of gray area, and I go back and forth between “he didn’t know” and “how the fuck could he not have known?” 

Does anyone have a similar experience or any kind of advice on how to identify/make peace with this kind of trauma? (Calling it trauma still feels disingenuous to me - but it causes me physical panic attacks, so....)",-2.0,-490.0,-175.0,-328.0,-165.0

176,176,176sad,sad,"Before I go into the full on vent, here's some context: 

- I'm not officially diagnosed however I'm trying to be and this is the conversation I had with my dad less than an hour before making this post.

- I consulted a college phychologist about ADHD, about a month or two before lockdown started, she said she can't 'formally' diagnose me but there is a high chance that I'm correct in my suspicion and there's also a chance that I have aspergers.

- I know I might make it sound bad, but my dad IS trying to be understanding (more so than my mum), he just believes mental health is 'made up' and 'all in your head'. Old fashioned, basically, and is convinced that there's nothing wrong with me and that I'm just believing everything I read on the Internet.

- This is translated and paraphrased from Polish because that's the language me and my dad speak. 

I'm trying to convince my parents to allow me to see a professional and get formally diagnosed and possibly put on some treatment, particularly about ADHD because it's started to seriously affect my college life. This is where today's conversation came in.

I've brought it up with my dad a few times already but I feel like he's dodging the topic, telling me ""yeah talk to your aunt she knows a phychologist"" but not understanding that I want him to sort me out an appointment because one, I'm 17 so I don't think I can get an appointment myself (I Think, I live in the UK but am currently in Poland and my parents would rather me see a Polish professional), and two, I'm too anxious to make the phone call myself and I do want him to be a part of this because I need him to understand.

But today I think I finally convinced him through a very painful conversation. Basically, we got into a bit of a spat earlier today regarding my anti-social spouts, and that I think he takes everything too personally because ""No, I'm not ignoring you on purpose, I just get lost in my own head and don't want to talk or interact sometimes. Sometimes I just dissociate.""

He wants me to constantly be smiling and takes it to heart when I just don't talk or 'seem sad' even though half (Actually like 80%) of the time I'm just thinking/over-thinking and I do have a bit of a resting b*tch face ngl. In all honesty, I don't smile that much, but not because I'm sad it's just I don't feel the need and don't want to. Same goes for constantly having to maintain conversation or ""Behave like I'm happy.""

I started tearing up before I even started the conversation, because I can't handle conflict and I was afraid of how he'll react. I continued to almost cry and aggressively claw at my hand throughout (I can't deal with huge amounts of emotion and start stimming really heavily when I'm even remotely anxious).

I always knew about the ADHD, I just didn't have a name to it until mid-highschool, but I've researched some on Aspergers/autism and noticed that a handful of symptoms align with my behaviour. I told him about a few symptoms I've seen in myself E. G:

Excessive Stimming. Leg shaking, scratching (myself, though that one is mostly when anxious), random snapping of fingers, imitating random noises (Like alarms or animals), and the worst which he can't tell me he doesn't see because he nags me for it almost daily: Pacing. And when I say pacing I mean spending hours walking from wall to wall lost in my own head with headphones, occasionally if I have a particularly intense daydream I tend to 'bounce' off the walls or imitate a few actions in my daydream. 

I've had trouble focusing since childhood, I'd spent lessons in primary zoned out and by the end I wouldn't even remember what happened. It was usually the only thing teachers complained about me. In high school it kinda got better but not really because I still had to constantly snap myself out of daydreams and try really hard not to fall asleep or space out. However, no one ever thought anything of it because I was a 'gifted' kid and tbh I didn't either. I got really good grades in the end but by that age I was starting to become more conscious that the amount of times I lose focus or how I behave in some cases is not normal. 

High emotional sensitivity, leading to an inability to compromise which is the root of 90% of our arguments. I can't argue face to face for the f*cking life of me, even if I know I'm going into a calm debate I just get overly emotional and it affects my ability to form coherent arguments. 

Issues socialising, I only really have two real friends and I don't talk to most people unless spoken to. I'm not on speaking terms with anyone but one of my classmates. I don't catch some social cues, over-share, over-think and over-analyse people's responses, don't know how to start or continue a conversation without the other person doing a fair share of leading the conversation. Dislike of eye contact. An aversion to physical contact, not always, I can get clingy occasionally but like a good 75% of the time I cringe. Heck, even with my own family I sometimes feel unnecessarily awkward. I'm mortified to make important phone calls. Constantly worried about people's opinion of me and seeking out approval. I tend to go into anti-social bouts where I don't wish to be interacted with in any way and would prefer to be left on my own. If I'm already in public, it shows as me being quiet and not contributing at all to the social event going on around me. 

Though this one is a bit of a paradox, because I DO experience spouts of becoming a social butterfly and once you get me started on a topic I'm currently passionate about I don't shut up to the point I tend to over-step what's an acceptable amount to explain. And my dad thinks that is the 'normal' side of me, that I'm normally in the 'social butterfly' mode and that's what he wants me to be all the time. He's starting to get the fact that I need my alone time and that I'm not always a social butterfly, but it makes me incredibly guilty to see him be bothered by my anti-social bouts. 

I want to say I've experienced a few 'special interests' especially as a child and even a few now BUT I'm not so sure on that topic and whether it truly applies to me.

Those are the ones most prominent I've noticed in me.

My dad passes most of those off as normal behaviour, chalking it up to me being a hormonal teenager and that once I'm an adult I'll grow out of all this. Here's the thing though: What if I don't? If I grow up and have it worse as an adult because I didn't do anything about it now? I already went completely under the rader as a kid, one because I was a 'gifted child' and two my parents don't believe in mental illness.

I didn't bring this topic up until high school because I simply didn't have a name to it, nor did I really know or care much about mental health. I'm not claiming to be an expert or anything, but I know what it's like to live inside my own head and can recognise that not everything I do and the way I think is normal. But because ""nothing was wrong with me before"" and ""suddenly you've come up with all these problems that you never mentioned before"" and ""I don't see anything wrong with you"" ""You've been influenced by your friends and the Internet"" ""You don't know what you're talking about"". He thinks that I've convinced myself to having these problems, because I just searched it up on the Internet and cherry picked what applies to me. 

And let's say that OK, maybe I have convinced myself because I've read too much sh*t on the Internet. Isn't it better to see a professional and find out anyway? To finally settle this once and for all instead of me wondering if there's something wrong with me? 

That's kinda what I finally convinced him with, he still thinks there's nothing wrong with me. I feel like I have ruined his holiday though, he was supposed to relax now that he can't really work during the pandemic. He told me how he ""misses the old times when I was a child and would always be smiling and enjoy holidays together without any emotional baggage or problems."" 

He's a good parent and I know he genuinely cares about me but is just incredibly ignorant on the topic of mental health and convinced that it doesn't really exist. (Like he gets everything else right as a dad BUT THIS.)",-1.0,-186.0,-279.0,-50.0,-285.0
177,177,177sad,sad,"I hate how some people think that having a mental illness is a trait or its somehow trendy. I also absolutely hate it when people throw around words loosely like ""depressed"", ""I'm so OCD, I need to arrange my pencils in a certain order"" ,"" I didnt eat this morning, I think I have anorexia"". It actually hurts coz it's so much harder to deal with when u actually suffer from it and u know the pain. 

Mental health used to be such a taboo topic. No one even discussed it a few years ago and now u see people joking around about it and romanticizing it. I joke around about suicide and depression coz I feel like I can cope better but when jokes are unnecessarily made, it pisses me off. 

I remember in our psychology class the teacher would always poke fun at the kids who were sleeping and srsly ask them if they had autism which doesn't even remotely make sense but everyone starts laughing as if it's funny, it just feels weird coz I'm actually on the spectrum or my own teacher would tell ppl to go hang themselves and she would have a straight serious face. Her teaching was excellent but she made fucking hippocratic ""jokes"" that she apparently thought were funny. 

I had a friend who wasnt depressed or suicidal or anything. But one day she noticed my self harm scars and told me that they looked cool and beautiful like wat..... and the next day she made self harm scars in designs like drawing carved lightly on her skin and went around the school showing it off. I honestly didnt know what to think of this imao. 

I remember when 13 reasons why came out I fucking loved the show. It was the only show that I had come across which actively talked about mental health and I was so excited and ofcourse i wasnt gonna listen to the warning pfft. The show was rly good. It was my favourite at the time. But I remember crying after every episode and cutting after every episode and attempted suicide after the show, ended up in the ICU came back to life obviously. This was obviously not because of the show, I had already been diagnosed with severe depression along with a few other mental illnesses. It was honestly my fault for watching it despite the warning. However, now I feel that the show did glorify suicide for eg:by showing hannah reacting to the people mourning after her death. Like when u die, ur gonna be gone. U won't know that people will fucking miss u. U wont fucking be there to see how ppl will react after ur death. It almost inserts a false perception into ur head. But I love how it openly talked about mental health issues that needed to be talked about but it was still romanticizing suicide in a way. 

People need to realize that mental health is the same as  physical health and it's about time ppl look at both mental and physical health equally.

life sucks”, or the most famous line as well as obnoxious “just pray about it”.

This honestly goes out to anyone who has children because if you'll treat them this way then you have no right to say that you are the victim in the situation, ignorance should not be excused if you don't even want to educate yourself. 

I show severe signs of depression and anxiety.

I was doing it to release all of the emotional weight off myself, on top of the fact that i believed and even still believe that i deserved that pain, but no, that woman won't ever just shut up and listen. 
This sense of entitlement that i've seen a lot of parents even today have, its so fucking toxic that if your child honestly starts hating you, you have absolutely no right to call them spoiled or shit kids, because this is your fault, especially if you were given the chance to change and educate yourself on the matter many times in the past. 

My depression wasn't caused by interacting with certain friends mom, it wasn't caused because i read about it IN ORDER to educate myself.

185,185,185sad,sad,"Context: 17F, 18 in a month, living in the US. Going to university in September.

I feel like somethings wrong with me. One of the main reasons is how I react to stress or frustration. When I get frustrated, I tend to harm myself (thankfully not by cutting, I can resist that urge) by punching myself in the face or back of the head repeatedly. If I’m around others I pull my hair. Something about that releases frustration for me, and I never leave visible bruises so I don’t really see a problem with it. Then I cry like a baby afterward and it’s embarrassing, even though I’m alone 90% of the time when I get like that. After the breakdown I either get a rush of adrenaline or feel drained and empty. 

Another thing is the way I socialise. I can’t tell when I’ve said something offensive or rude until the person gets mad and stops talking to me. And even then I have to ask what I said wrong. I also stutter a lot, have to repeat myself, and backtrack to make sure what I said made sense. I tend to obsess over fictional universes (Steven Universe is a huge obsession right now, going on 8 months) and annoy my friends because that’s literally all I talk about, especially if they have no clue what it is. Social events are hell for me because fandoms are the only way I can connect with people, so if it’s an event with mainly adults or little kids, I feel alone and awkward. 

I flinch at loud noises, sudden movements, and slight touches despite having never been hit or abused in any way. I’ve searched every memory from the time I was a little kid and can’t remember a single time I was hit maliciously (fights with my brother don’t count because we never went for each other’s faces).

Physically I use my hands as a nervous habit a lot. Years ago I realised that when I walk, my arms hang like everyone else’s but felt wrong, so now I constantly play with my hands. Cracking knuckles, moving my fingers around, snapping, and even digging my nails into my skin are my main nervous habits. If I’m really stressed or anxious I bite my fingers.

About 4 years ago my Mother was diagnosed with ALS and given maybe a year to live. Me, my Dad and my Sister were there to support her for the next 9 months as she slowly stopped being able to talk and to eat on her own. The ALS really only effected her mouth and throat. After about 9 months she eventually ended up vomiting, aspirating it, and getting a severe repository infection. Her immune system couldn’t keep up anymore and she died.

Ever since then I have temporarily dropped out of high school at grade 11 because of the stress it was causing me. I have been to a few different councillors and have been on Prozac for depression for a while. About two years ago I came off the Prozac and seemed okay.

It is now 6 days till the 3rd anniversary of her death and for the last 2 weeks I have been cripplingly afraid of dying. Not of when it will happen but of the endless nothingness afterward. I know that it is somewhat irrational but my brain keeps saying it isn’t.

Over the last week I have gotten slightly better by just talking to my Dad and my consultant that I’ve known for 8 years and I am trying to make an appointment with another councillor. But with COVID-19 it is getting pretty difficult to get into somewhere.

Luckily, I haven’t been suicidal at any point.

I mentioned to my Dad yesterday that it might be some sort of PTSD from the 9 month period because any time I hear death mentioned I have what is basically a small panic attack. I have not been in contact with anyone outside my family for the last 6 months but I’m not very social anyway.

I came here hoping someone has some advice or maybe had even been in the same sort of situation before. If you have any questions please feel free to ask.

Long story short, I give up as soon as I can to go back to doing nothing (gaming, internet etc). College took a break for Coronavirus and tried to do online stuff but didn't do a good job of it. I saw the opportunity and ""sub-consciously"" took it. I say that with quotes because I barely feel like I'm making logical decisions anymore, my body just says words and I live with the consequences later . I put in a letter of 'paused study' which means I take a break and pick up next semester. Studying online felt rough since I kept having to ask the lecturer questions on almost anything that we covered and even then I wasn't getting it.

My mum is extremely disappointed since she knows she didn't raise me with those kinda morals and she's right she didn't but I can't pull myself out of the 16 year long depression that I've been in. Every opportunity I've ever had has been screwed up either by me or by random circumstances. I lost all motivation to continue and I just can't be bothered with anything outside of gaming etc. Mum's put a lot of effort into motivating me with stuff and occasionally asks me how getting back into college is going, which I just get mad at her and try and shift the blame or attention somewhere else (either to a lecturer or an email not getting replied to).

That leads to tonight where she broke down and said she can't do it anymore. This has happened before and its for the same reasons. But this time felt different as she asked me what I wanted to do with my life, truly. I told her I don't want to do anything, I don't like the world with the people in it they're all greedy and self-centered etc etc. I understand there's some people out there who aren't like that but they are almost always superseded by a dozen of others. I told her I didn't want to live in that world and she said ""You want to kill yourself!?"" to which I agreed. I remember that since I was about 6 I was sitting in the bath with her next to me as ""I cried out I don't wanna live anymore"". I didn't think much of it but I noticed she immediately got more upset.

She got up and walked away and I followed her out. She turned to me and said ""Fine I'll say it. Kill yourself if you want to. I know that's what you've been waiting for someone to say"". It's true, it hit me hard but its true. I had been waiting 16 years for someone I loved to seriously tell me that. But as soon as she said it she started crying since, well, no mother should feel like they have to say those words. She walked away again and I followed her and gave her a hug as she told me how I keep blaming others and getting mad at her for trying to help. About wasted potential and squandered opportunity.

I just, I can't ever care about anyone other than myself. I don't feel empathy or sympathy towards other people, I don't get happy or sad. I used to get angry but that's dialed back a lot in the last few years. I think the best way to describe my emotions is ""disappointed"" and ""not-disappointed"". If someone says they're going to do something and they do it, I'm not disappointed in that even if they did a great job on it I still feel the same. If they don't do it then I'm disappointed and I just try and forget that we ever had an interaction and go back to doing 'nothing'. When I'm doing 'nothing', my mind is focused on the task at hand and I don't have time for emotions. I just do what I think will progress me to more content either something good to watch or best decision in a video-game.

I've done a couple jobs and courses around the place, work for the dole type deals. None have lasted more than a year and the first study I chose to do I didn't finish since I missed one assignment and they said I had to redo it, so surprise I didn't do it. I once had to move up north of the city (am currently south of it) for some work with a random company who promised a short course and guaranteed work at the end. I spent 3 months with them and then 1 week with a ""sister company"" for $150. They lied about work and the qualification they provided wasn't anything besides manual labour. When I asked them about the work they pawned me off to the owner's sister's friend's company who lied about how I didn't need my license.

I do stuff around the house, I'm respectful to guests and the rest of the family here. Mum says I'm a smart guy who could do well if he put in the effort. I'm taking medication that seemed to improve me from who I was before I started taking it. I've seen I believe 7 psychologists and nothing much has come of it besides the medication and saying how I don't have Borderline Personality Disorder.

I don't know what to expect from this lengthy post, its a vent but its also an admission of guilt. Guilt I feel is about how I'm emotionally a void. I cry when others cry or talk about something I've done in the past I'm not proud of. I don't remember the last time I was happy, only the times when something has made me laugh. We all make mistakes but I don't know how to fix this one.

 No I'm not going to kill myself.

189,189,189sad,sad,"Hi all,

I’m near the end of high school in Australia and I’m finding myself in a difficult place. Until a year ago, I was doing very well in school and I expected to do very well last year and this year, but I didn’t. The problems I’ve faced include:
- Perfectionism resulting in procrastination due to inability for every assignment to be perfect
- Executive dysfunction (this has always been a problem but I’ve reached the point where the work is difficult enough that this impacts my grades)
- Emotionally abusive household
- Burnout

I try my hardest despite these but I’ve repeatedly failed and others have berated me for it, making me feel I don’t deserve to exist. But not only am I scared of failure, I’m also scared of success. I don’t like being praised or otherwise knowing that I’m doing well from others (grades, money, etc.) because it makes me feel like I’m being moulded and manipulated into what someone else wants me to be - not *who I am.*

I don’t want to be a drone, but I don’t to be a failure. I don’t want to freeload, but I don’t want to work. I don’t want to be pathetic, but I don’t want to be successful. I don’t want to be traumatised, but I don’t want to heal because I don’t know what I feel and think besides all of the negative thoughts.

But, I don’t know what I *do* want, either. I’ve recently come to the realisation that all my dreams and aspirations are really just my interpretation of what I think others expect of me and I never really wanted to do any of it. Still, I don’t have something I want to do besides all this. I’m not even one of those kids who has the wild daydream fantasy of playing video games for a living - I can’t imagine a single thing that I *want* to do.

About the only thing I think I want is to move out of home to escape my condescending parents, and that’s about it. I have no additional plans besides working a job that I haven’t decided on and finding a close friend to heal with.

**How do I learn to look inwards and discover who I am; who I want to be; what my identity is?** I don’t know who I am and I don’t know who I want to be. I can’t even describe or know my interests, my goals (besides that immediate one), my personality, or even my *gender* and I don’t know how I will discover them. All I see when I look inwards is a pathetic, hurt wreck, but I know that that’s not me - that’s my trauma.

Also, **how can I decide that success is a good thing and get over my fear of it, including my fear of being successful at healing?** Yes I am scared of success, but I know that I’ll be happier once I’m not because if I aspire to be successful, I’ll have more money or more spare time or more happiness or whatever it is that I discover that I want. I’m even scared of being successful at overcoming my trauma, and the dilemma between healing and not healing has kept me awake at night.

I’ve been getting treatment for anxiety and depression for years now but it all feels like a dead end. Every time I tell my family I’m depressed their only advice is to ask for a new medication. I’m fucking sick of meds. I’ve been on countless meds since I was 12 for one thing or another and I hate them. The ones I’m on right now make me vomit if I don’t eat a full meal before taking them. 

I only ever have about as much energy as it takes to get from my bed to the bathroom every day, let alone work and eat and do functional people things, but no one seems to take me seriously. It’s always “man that sucks” or “I feel that” or “have you been taking your meds?”. I get no help from anyone that actually means anything. I feel like I’m screaming into a void and no one is actually paying attention. I feel so incredibly alone.

193,193,193sad,sad,"To sum up, for as long as I can remember I've felt like an alien in my own skin. A grotesque monster like Frankenstein or a side show freak. I do not recognize myself if I look in the mirror and it is hard for me to feel attacted to my own limbs and other body parts. If I'm sitting in a group I feel like a shadow creeping in on normal humans. On my own I question if my body functions in a way that is human or if I'm some how completely wrong and poorly replicating it.

I have been diagnosed with depression, social anxiety and PTSD but never deeply divulged the extent of my feelings or lack of towards my body to any health worker. More and more recently I have felt that I am living without actually having an active role in my life. 

Idk why I'm posting this just that I need to get the thoughts out. I'm 21 almost 22 and feel as if I've not actually lived a life but just performing tasks that are expected of me. Worse is that my ""alien"" feelings are becoming confirmed in my mind as I get older. I've never had a relationship or even a mutual liking towards someone. I don't have close friendships or family members. At school I'm unnoticeable and unremarkable.This was unchanged by covid and while everyone around me finds it hard being alone its been my default. I've tried to change the social relationships around me and improve on my outside physical vessel but it never seems to work. 

I've concluded I've failed at being human. And although I've resisted suicidal thoughts as much as possible it's becoming easier imagining that if I'm dead it leaves space and resources to someone that is actually human. And my death is for the betterment of those around me to eliminate and reallocate the resources extended to my body. So at this point the only thing stopping me from ending it is not having the energy or willpower. So I guess rn I'm just gonna keep my body going like an old broken down vehicle that only runs some of the time and never quite right. 

I don't mean to sound overly whiney and like I'm seeking compliments or to be pacified. I'm just not in a position to talk to anyone regarding this.

But, growing up I had very few genuine friends. In elementary school, I had a friend who was jealous of me, she would talk about me behind my back and even gaslighted my best friend about me and another one who would put me down constantly. Middle school, I had a falling out with a close friend every year because of bs or because they betrayed my trust or me as a person. The worst year was 7th grade. Before I moved, I was friends with a group of boys and I started dating one of them and one of the guys started bullying me relentlessly until I moved. Then that summer when I made friends at my new school, one of my friends let my other friend who I had a falling out with go off on me via text. 9th grade, two of my friends became closer with each other and ultimately pushed me out of the group (I believe it was unintentionally though because I don't have ill feelings about them) and another friend started ignoring me out of nowhere. The rest of high school was me having school friends except for maybe three. I'm still friends with them, but casually. 

I'm 21 now, and I'm scared to make new friends and get close to people because I'm afraid they're gonna either a) get sick of me eventually b) abandon me or 3) tell people personal things about me like my old friends.

I'm just at a complete loss of what to do.

I've never been known to be the kind of person to stand up for myself. If being complacent meant keeping another person happy, then I'd have no problem doing so.

However, I'm sitting in bed at 3 A.M. completely angry and frustrated because I've let people walk over me for too long.

My big issue at the moment is that I'm currently living with my grandma and she brought a guy into the house. My parents had moved out of the house and I stayed behind while my friend moved in. This was an arrangement I was happy with. Both my friend and I would pay rent to my mom each month and we would both live in the house. Then one day, my mom told me my grandma was moving in because she was breaking up with her current boyfriend and had nowhere else to stay. I wasn't too bothered by it at the time. She kept to herself and never really intruded around the house.

Not too long after she moved in, my friend was evicted for not paying rent which left my grandma and I. Because he was gone and my grandma kept to herself, the house started to feel like my own. I managed to pull myself out of a depression and began making the house my own. I would cook, spend time in the living room which I had personally furnished. I felt comfortable in what was essentially my own home.

Then around the same time, I feel like my grandma felt the same way. She began decorating. Placing photos on desks which I was using for my own stuff. Placing questionable figurines and art around the house (a notable one being that of a small indian man which scares me just about every night because it looks so realistic.) The decorating wouldn't have been such an issue had it not been so intrusive. I had made the living room to my personal liking (considering the fact I never used the living room even when my family lived here). She also began cooking questionable meals that were either barely cooked, made with completely crazy ingredients (such as a burrito with bologna, ketchup, and mashed potatoes), or were murdered with salt. Because she was always cooking, I lost my own desire to cook and just began getting takeout every day; something that she essentially makes fun of me for.

I could put almost all of this aside and live peacefully with her (and I did) until a few weeks ago when I came home to a car that I had never seen before. I assumed it might be one of my cousin's cars who frequently makes visits. It was also very late so I didn't think too much of it. I was in the living room the next morning and a man I had never seen before comes walking in with my grandma behind him. She introduces him and says that he's her new boyfriend. Again, I let it slide. She probably met him a little while back and best case scenario, she can move in with him or it'll be a small relationship and I'll never see him again.

Then one day, I came home and one of my dogs was tied up, one was in a cage essentially crying for me, and when I walked into the house, I discovered the entire living room carpet was gone and all the furniture was rearranged. I asked my grandma about it and she said that her boyfriend wanted to get rid of the carpet to replace it with new carpet and that she was afraid that the dogs would run away (which they won't considering they never have).

To wrap up my issues, I am actually extremely angry that this man I've never met before is essentially moving himself in and making changes to a house I just now started to become comfortable in. I wanted to talk to my mom about it tomorrow because she's the one who owns the house but I know the conversation will not go in my favor. She'll probably just tell me that it's best if I moved out which is an awful idea. I have such a connection to this house because as a kid, we were moving around so much. The longest house I had lived in prior to this one was no more than 4 years. Finally, now that I have a house that I feel is my own, it's being completely intruded on. And I wouldn't be able to afford my own place considering my job pays like crap (I could leave that job but that's a whole can of worms and another essay long as to why I haven't left). And I can't rightfully leave that job because it's owned locally and the boss relies on me so heavily that leaving would ruin our admittedly good relationship and possibly make his business harder to run.

In short, I feel like a house I've just learned to love is being intruded on and there's very little I can do about it besides make myself seem like a bad person in my grandma's eyes.

I have no idea what to do. I feel like I have no control over my own life. And if I do attempt to take control, I'm an asshole. I'm trapped.

Unfortunately, this is just the basis of my issues at the moment and it feels like it's boiling over badly. I've fallen back into my depression, have been drinking a lot, and am just generally angry and exhausted all the time.

But recently especially(because of the current state of the world and the political climate) I have been exposed to a lot of information, news, events, things said/done by celebs etc about issues on literally every possible topic. I see the problems, the bad, and the things I find disgusting and horrible but get sucked in.

I care and advocate for black people and the racism towards them disgusts me.

205,205,205sad,sad,"My daughter is a year and two months. I love her to death. She is my everything in this entire world. I could lose everything else, but as long as I have her, I'll be fine.

A little to explain...

I was homeless when I found out I was pregnant with her. I am an abuse victim from both my childhood and my adulthood. I have childhood Dissociative PTSD with trauma based hallucinations, GAD and Depression that worsened with my Ex. I had just been kicked out by my grandmother. My abusive father gave me up to her after years of mental, physical and S-xual abuse as a minor. When I was kicked out due to my grandmother not liking my friends and my severe mental breakdown. I couldn't work, go to school and I could barely leave the house due to my dissociation. She forced me to go back to work too soon with the threat of kicking me out, which caused me to lose my job. I started getting better but still wasn't working as often as they would like me too. So, they pushed all of my bills and $500 of rent on me to force me to start working more.

 I decided to get away and go on a 4 day vacation with someone they never met. While I was gone my grandmother had to be hospitalized for high blood pressure and I couldn't get back into town. When I returned I was told I was never allowed back. The house, everything was locked, even the garage. She thought I was with my friends from school that she didn't like. So, I was kicked out. 

I ended up moving in with someone who turned out to resemble my father. Controlling, manipulative, abusive. Just a terrible human being. I couldn't work, leave the house. He worked offshore for two weeks at a time. I would be alone for two weeks having to ration out my food. The one time I left without his permission while he was there, he forced me back inside and forced himself on me while screaming in my face how terrible of a human being I was. My daughter was sadly conceived through a day of force.

I ended up leaving him and went homeless, only to find out I was pregnant three days in. I planned on aborting but was denied twice due to my poor mental health. My ex told me that he did not want this child to live, but didn't want anything bad to happen to me. Under any circumstances. He didn't want her to live. Therefore. He was gone. He doesn't know that she is alive. Her name. Where she is. His name isn't on her birth certificate. No one on his family knows she is alive.

I moved in with my mother who I hadn't lived with in years after two weeks of homelessness. I went to file a restraining order but since it was past a months time, they couldn't do anything.

I had an angry pregnancy where I didn't want to feel her move, see her photos, talk about her. When she was born, I had to learn to separate her from my abuse. Learning that it wasn't her fault. I worked hard on learning to bond and love her. 

Yet, now. I seem to depend on her. I feel like we have been through so much together. Even though she wasn't born and didn't have to experience it. I feel very protective over her. To the point I'm willing to end any and all relationships that may get cross. I feel bad, but I scold my boyfriend (Who I met at 5-6 months pregnant) if he gets too frustrated with her. I feel bad because I told him that if it comes down to her or him, it will be her everytime. If I have a bad PTSD night, She is in bed with me and just looking at her makes me feel like I can breathe.

My daughter gets very clingy with me as well, but I know that is just a toddler thing. I go through days where I just need to be able to see her. It makes it hard to work and do normal things. As I speak she is laying next to me in bed where I can watch her tiny sleeping face. I get nightmares and I need her. I have trouble sleeping and I need her. I'm having a bad day and I need her. I'm upset and I need her.

I just feel like there is something connected so deeply in my past trauma with the two of us. That we survived together. We made it out alive together. We want each other... Yet, at the same time, I know that it's just me. It's just my brain trying to attach itself to something so I feel less alone, scared and traumatised. That I attached myself to her so I feel like I'm not alone in my trauma. That I'm sharing it with someone and we are making it through together... But it was me. Not her. I did. And it makes me feel so alone. I try so hard not to cry in front of her. My father did that to me while he slit his wrists. I remember how terrible it felt. I do my hardest not too... But it just gets to be so hard sometimes. I don't know how to set healthy boundaries with her. She isn't my therapist. She isn't a coping doll. She's a human being and she shouldn't be forced to be my comfort item.

206,206,206sad,sad,"(First paragraph is context) My Uncle David was not supposed to live past his 5th birthday and has proved that wrong by being a beautiful and amazing influence in my family's life for over 50 years. He was born to my grandmother, his birth father left before the end of the pregnancy and his entire side of the family wanted nothing to do with my grandmother and her downs child. He has obviously created a lot of issues and obstacles in her life but she eventually found a man that would accept David for who he is rather than what he has. I digress, David has like I said; created a lot of obstacles but was a loving big brother to his siblings including my mother; along with all of his nieces and nephews. This stands out to me more than most because I grew up with him being around and being the first grandchild I was given a lot more attention by the family than the predecessors. I live him almost as much as he loves me and that is why I feel obligated to help as much as possible even if I can't schedule doctor's appointments. 

Roughly 2 years ago, David moved out of my grandparent house and began living with my mother. Things were normal as they could be and everything seemed well. My grandfather has taken a job 2 hours away and they could not take David with them, my mother volunteered to take care of her big brother while they were away. 

My grandparents returned home after my grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer. She went through all the treatment and she is now a survivor and cancer free. They performed multiple surgeries and she was bandaged and bedded at home for some time. Everyone decided that David needed to stay at my mom's house longer until my grandmother fully recovered due to David being very sensitive when he is aware that his family members are ""hurt"" or ""sick."" He usually becomes overwhelmingly concerned and upset especially when his mother is sick; so it is safe to say that was a good call.

The issues began maybe 3 months ago. My mother ran into a mouse problem in her house while David was staying there. They mice were quickly exterminated and it was not an issue. I moved out of my mother's house as did my step-brother. Maybe a week before I left, David began having sleeping issues. He would stay awake all night even without any distractions. He would lay or sit in his bed throughout the night and then get up when everyone finally awoke for the morning. He would then be very drowsy and tired throughout the day and even falling asleep at dinner and outside. He would get maybe 2 hours of sleep throughout the day with 20 minute intervals of dozing off. 

This seems all quite standard, he just has sleeping issues. This is were things get disturbing, David began talking about seeing mice. He would describe them like a six year old would describe a nightmare about rats. He says they have bitten him, hit him, squeaked at him, and just generally distracted him from sleeping. This was assumed to be an excuse for him not sleeping as he often makes immature excused for a lot of his behavior. However after some time we all realized that his in genuinely seeing mice and he isn't lying about it. He would point in a dark corner and say ""there's a mouse"" after investigating and discovering there is no mouse he would accept is and laugh. 

We cleaned out his entire bedroom, moved furniture and moved him into a different room, to no avail. David would talk about seeing a mouse or some mice in various locations where he sleeps. He was scared of them and David is very hard to scare. He loves horror and is never scared by anything other than real danger. His voice shakes and he tries his best to explain his terror. 

Everyone decided it was time for him to come home, he needed to be back in his parents house and maybe he would be able to sleep and stop seeing mice. I have been staying with them and helping keep an eye on him. Everything seemed fine for maybe a week. He went to the doctor, they gave him some sleeping medicine and he slept well for maybe 5 nights. Now, he is back to being unable to sleep, he takes his pills and he still just sits and lays there. He whispers to me and says, ""there's a mouse under the bed."" I tell him there is no mouse, I look under the bed I confirm there is no mouse and he is alright, an hour later he is back at it. Yesterday, he came outside where I was swimming and brings me his shoe and says there is a mouse inside of it. I turn it over, sake it, put my hand inside, beat it on the wall, and say ""no mouse in here."" He accepted it and walked off with a smile. Maybe 10 minutes later, I see him investigating the shoe, looking down the sole, shaking ti, beating it out, doing everything I did except putting his hand inside. He was handling the shoe in a way you would expect someone to handle a shoe if there was a mouse inside, expecting it to fall out. 

Me and my family are at a dead confusion, my grandparents are little help as there are old and tend to have the ""shake it off"" mentality. With Covid, it is hard to get an appointment. I have thought of ideas including buying snake food mice and killing them in front of him to maybe shake this. We thought that bringing him home would take care of it. He is getting drained by this endevour and it is making him incredibly depressed.

bit of a vent sesh as well, my apologies. there’s a lot going on in my head as i type this. 

a little context: i grew up in an abusive/neglectful home. father being the abuser, mother being the neglectful one. my father is now out of the picture (thank god) but i still live w my mom. i didn’t realize my home life wasn’t ideal until about 15. things my father should’ve gotten arrested for i thought everyone experienced until my friends at the time told me otherwise. my whole life i’ve made light of the situation, i’ve never really felt affected by my childhood, just thought it made me more independent, which is a valuable skill, so why be upset over something i’m not dealing with anymore and made me stronger?

because i was a kid. i didn’t need strength i needed safety. and i’ve only come to that realization recently. only over the past month or so has it set in what i’ve really experienced and how awful it was. and i draw connections from my problematic habits now (such as allowing myself to be used by men because i want to help them, or more generally putting people before myself to an extreme).

all the time i make jokes about daddy issues. it’s funny because i’m functional. i’ve been told i’m “doing surprisingly well” for someone who’s gone through what i have. and i’m inclined to agree. until i realize that, again, i’m not living as people are supposed to. it makes me furious my dad has this effect on my life. i don’t care about him, so why am i still hurting? but the same thing happens with my other forms of trauma as well.

i make jokes. i don’t even notice when it happens sometimes. watching people overdose, having someone try to kill you, rape, etc. are all trauma. all of these i’ve experienced. and i never think it’s a big deal til i’m pulling at my hair, sweating, sobbing, and punching my bed at 4 in the morning. that’s when i think i need therapy. til i stop about an hour or two later, go to bed, and forget about it. these episodes come about every couple days. sometimes they’re less severe (sudden tears and silent sobbing for a couple minutes, not feeling and wiping the tears away for a couple minutes, repeat for an hour). i don’t like that i don’t know my own emotions, and i don’t know how to handle them. my only coping mechanisms are unhealthy and self destructive, and that was with stuff that bothered me less than this. i’m a little scared i could do some real damage to myself if i let my emotions get the best of me and can’t find a healthy way to handle this on a daily basis.

212,213,213sad,sad,"I just want to preface this by saying I’m not gonna kill myself anytime soon. I just really really want to.

One of my problems is that I have a really hard time opening up to anyone about any of my problems, especially family. I just know that if I tell them any problem I’m having that’s what they’re gonna think of anytime they think of me. I just keep up an image of a guy who really doesn’t care about anything and is always looking on the bright side, even though that couldn’t be further from the truth. 

I’m 16, so I still live at home with my parents, which means I have to go through them to get any mental health services. Earlier this year, things finally got so bad that I asked my parents to see a therapist, by saying it was because of stress at school. I already could barely stand telling my parents this, but then it got so much worse. I made the mistake of telling my therapist I was cutting, and then he told my parents. And now they know I’m a cutter, and now I know they think of me as a cutter. After they found out, I could barely talk to them anymore and I because a lot more withdrawn. I couldn’t stand being around them, because I knew what they were thinking. 

It got bad enough that I told my therapist I might try to kill myself, and he sent me to a psych ward. It was absolute hell. Now my parents think of me as a psych patient. And now I know every time my parents see me they see a psych patient. Each time they visited me I could barely talk to them, it hurt like red hot fire. When I got discharged I guess they realized I really didn’t want to talk about this anymore so they didn’t bring it up. But I know they’re still thinking about it. I know every time I see them. I’ve managed to keep up the charade of being happy, playing it off as a miraculous recovery and I’m 100% fine now for sure. But I know they know that’s not the case. I know they’re still thinking of me like that. I know they know I’m lying.

But now my birthday is coming up, and our family has a tradition of talking about everything going on in the past year. I’m dreading this, because even if they don’t mention it, I know for sure they’re going to be thinking about what happened to me. And I know it’s gonna be absolute hell to me. And I can’t tell them that I can’t do it this year, because then they’re gonna need a reason. And I can’t give them a reason because that’s even worse. I just wish I never had to see them or anyone who knows anything about me ever again. I wish I could just die. But I can’t. I don’t know what to do. Every option hurts too much. I’ve stuck bandaid over bandaid on all my problems and they’re so dangerously close to bursting off. What do I do? 

I don’t know why I care about this stuff so much, but I do. Anyone I’m close to knowing any problem I’m having quite literally worse than death. I just hate it so much, and it’s preventing me from doing so much. What do I do?",-2.0,-289.0,-104.0,-157.0,-135.0

I've been struggling with depression and anxiety my whole life, from what I have been told by a psychiatrist years ago I understand it's probably genetic (I have not looked further into it so apologies if its actually impossible, but there is a pattern running up my maternal line). There was a period of time in school (from ages ~12-18) where I was suicidal, but lazy. I wanted to die, I just didnt want to go through with the effort. I tried strangling myself, overdosing on my psych medication, I held a knife to my wrists, but I just couldn't do it. Maybe I was afraid of doing it myself, afraid it would hurt, or just afraid of it while simultaneously wanting it. I dont know.

I've been out of high school for a few years now and began college after a period of self exploration, and I guess you can say that I'm doing better. If I wasn't afraid of death before, I can safely tell you that I am now. I am truly afraid of death, and its keeping me awake at night. I cry and get anxious and sad because I know theres nothing I can do about it. I love my parents, but there will always be a small part of me that hates them because they created me knowing I would die some day, that it would hang over me until it inevitably happened, and that I would lose a lot of people I hold dear to the very thing I am afraid of along the way. I want to stop driving a car/going on the road  (and a lot more things) because I know one accident could end it all. I dont stop doing these things, because I know my life would be more miserable without them.

 I'm angry and frustrated that no matter what I do, how hard I work, I will die no matter what. I could live the best life or the worst, it's all going to end either way. One of my greater fears is getting some sort of brain degenerative disease (which also runs in the family, so it is a possibility), to lose my dignity and my memories and me. Part of me hopes for it, so that I wouldnt have to know that I would be in the process of dying. 

I have mostly stepped out of the wanting to die stage in my life (hopefully for good) and now I have crippling anxiety and anger following me around. Every once in a while I have a split second thought that I should just get it over with so that I dont have to deal with it anymore, but I never act on it nor do I want to. Even if I did, I would have a panic attack before I could even do anything.  I have a lot of things I value in life to go so soon.

Now, many of you can think that this behaviour of overthinking or thoughts only occurs with the people i love, but that’s not true.

At first, I thought all of thoughts were the result of watching thriller or action movies, since I watch a lot of movies. But I’ve started watching light hearted comedy/rom-coms, but same situation. Same thing i did for music, listening to calming music, nature’s sound etc etc.

I’ve tried medication, meditation. I’m even on a pill that i take 2 everyday(since Jan’20) to reduce hypertension. But seems not working at all.

221,222,222sad,sad,"I feel like I have no right to complain or to be sad at all...

I made a mistake that changed everything, and I got hurt by others as well, which is fine.

But, when I start feeling depressed or nervous, I get told that pretty much I don't have any right to complain, and that I should ignore what everyone else says and just focus on myself.

Four months of isolation thanks to the pandemic didn't help either.

I realized that I made a mistake by taking 100% of the blame... I have at most 50% of it, as they were people who hurt me when I didn't do anything to deserve it.

Aside from a few people, I'm alone, and when I say alone, I mean the type of crippling loneliness that burns you with frostbite from the inside.

I awake to an empty What's App most of the time, I deactivated my Facebook account because I was tired of being left in seen again and again, and I don't really use social media to talk to others anymore aside of Reddit.

These days I've been feeling terrible, I ended up shivering from an anxiety attack at Friday, I get cold feet a lot, sometimes my stomach hurts or I overeat to calm down, it takes me in between 30-60 minutes to get asleep, I can't focus to study or do homework properly now that I'm back in class and so on...

And if life is focused on ""utility"", rather than honor or respect... Then I ended up being a tool for many people, and once I fulfilled my purpouse, they discarded me.

I will have to do months or years of therapy, just to become somewhat functional... Only to ignore what everyone else says or thinks, and just focus 100% on myself, while waiting for some miracle to happen.

Some people are strong enough to live on their own, to not need friends and just be happy with themselves, which is perfectly fine. But I'm not one of those people, nor I could become like that even if I tried...

In a nutshell, people can hurt me, betray me, manipulate me, use me and then discard me, treat me like garbage or just with pure indifference, and that's perfectly fine.

But, when I start feeling depressed or bad, because it's just too much, I'm the one who's wrong, I'm the one who should ignore everyone else, be positive, accept my circumstances and keep shut about it.

I'm mostly alone and isolated, my support structure is very, very small, they'll probably give us more and more homework and group projects at online classes (which make me very nervous to think about)... I feel like I want to snap.

There's no mercy, forgiveness or compassion for me... Just indifference, pain and loneliness...

I don't know what else to do... If I don't make therapy work it'll be useless, my stomach can't handle most pills and so on...

I guess I wasn't meant to be happy... Once I messed everything up, I have to accept that I'll surely have a broken, lonely and empty future...

I feel like I will eventually end up taking my life, because I keep losing and losing, and life keeps telling that I have no right to complain, and that there's no turning back from the past...

But now I don't know, the motivation I had isn't there anymore with the exception of occasional bursts that disappear as fast as they arrive

I want to be able to sit down and talk through my feelings, even if just to myself. But doing that feels impossible because I immediately get overwhelmed with emotions.

I borrowed a FM radio from my parents and would fall asleep listening to a French comedy channel so as to keep my mind from having dark/scary thoughts. Today, I am 27, and my anxiety and depression grew to where it paralyses me and makes me unable to achieve anything. Even the smallest task feels like climbing a mountain. I quit my job because I would start crying in the middle of my shifts or hide because my stomach would hurt from anxiety. I only feel good for a couple minutes a day and it's often mixed with a feeling of melancholy.  I have a dream of having a musical career, I have been working towards this goal for 12 years and yet have nothing to show for it. I tried meditating, exercising, I took supplements, made sure to eat healthy, sleep on schedule... I am so tired of always feeling like I am dragging my body behind me wherever I want to go and making my family worry for me. I am terrified of continuing to live like this...

I cried and cried and cried. After doing my graduate, i burst with sadness i cried so much no one was able to stop me. I heard voices and vfb oices and cry. They gave me meds. Every 3 months i used to burst with tears and crying. All becausecof voices. I go for our holy mosque. I went to spiritual people.  No one helped me but criticize me like everything that is happening to me is my fault. Then i came to US after one year i again burst with tears. This time i was not resting but walking n walking. My sis took me to a lady she made me cry. My own relatives made me cry. My own sis never see me with smile. My own mother made me cry. Hence there was no one in this world that hasn't made me cry.

233,234,234sad,sad,"So pretty much what happened was a lot. It started in November 2019, I couldn't eat, and would throw up a lot, still don't know what was up with that, it went on until April 2020, it's just kinda been shrugged off as anxiety. It got really bad in January, I was down 12 pounds from already severely underweight and in and out of the hospital almost constantly. This caused me to have 59 attendence strikes 2nd semester, for a triple honors class kid going into concert season, it was really bad with low grades and missing work. But all of that was minute compared to February. 

On one of the last days in January my now ex asked me to meet him somewhere and I did, no big deal, we're dating, probably a pop date or something. Long story short I got raped. Or at least I think I did? He wanted to do sex and I did not. I told him no but he kept saying ""come on, don't you love me?"" ""Don't you trust me?"" And pushing me back against this one wall in the dugout we were in until I just kind of nodded. It wasn't vaginal penetration cause he simply couldn't find it, but it was anal and it hurt like a bitch. There was no pleasure and I wanted to stop after it first started but he said no, that we would be fine, that we were too far in to stop and that I should relax and enjoy it. I didn't even moan, there was simply no feeling. I just kinda let my mind go blank, like retreating into my head or go afk but in real life. I wish I had struggled more, but I didn't which is why I don't think it was rape, but on the other hand I was pressured into consent and when I tried to take it back I was denied. Either way it was statutory, he was a week past his 16th (age of consent in my state) and I was a week from my 15th, so still 14. 

A few hours after that a friend died of cancer, she was 16, her birthday was in April. A few hours after her one of my friends grandpa also passed away, all of my extended family lives pretty far away so he was like my grandpa as said friend was my ""cousin"" and most people assumed we were actually siblings. Three blows within 24 hours. As mentioned, my birthday was the next week, it was spent at both funerals. The following week was Valentine's day, supposed to be our 6 month. He broke up with me on February 12, and was dating one of my friends within the week. 

Right after I had gone through the shock of two deaths, the illness was getting way worse, I was at my lowest weight - 84. NOT healthy for a 5'4 15f. I genuinely felt I was going to die, if not throwing up, then chronic migraines and worrying fevers. Anyway, fast forward to February-July. Almost everytime I sleep I see one of the three events and wake up sweating and crying when it's really cold in my room and I sleep with no blankets. 

Whenever me and my boyfriend are talking and he makes a sexual innuendo as even a joke I get really bad flashbacks to that one night and other events like when he'd grope me on the bus when I'd tell him stop he'd just tell me to shush or cover my mouth. I know I was more of just a number to him, but it was nice to have some attention as my relationship prior to that was extremely physically abusive and I have lots of pictures of bruises from that one, and he also would sexually assault me, though I'd fight back and he'd threaten my little sister or smack me so I'd stop which is why I think I didn't fight the guy after him either. So yeah, the flashbacks can send me through whirls of sadness, anger, etc. And get triggered by sounds, scents, etc. Like they make it hard to breathe or move or anything and it's like I have to relive it every time and I just want it to stop. I just want everything to stop.

It feels a little better to kind of vent it all out though some of my friends say I should be over it by now. But I'm still not sure if it is PTSD or if it's normal or anything.

236,237,237sad,sad,"Hey,

I’m a teenager, and I have a couple of problems.


So, first things first. Me and my mother don’t have a good relationship. We clash and she very, VERY obviously favours my younger sibling to me. She vents all of her stress into me and in return, this has started to take a toll on me. It’s not extreme abuse or anything, it’s just terrible wording and the constant complaining/nagging at me for minimalistic things, getting mad at me for making a glass of water but not my sister (even though she never asked for one), telling me I cannot be stressed and other things that I personally find quite harmful. I don’t even see her as a mother figure anymore, I feel much safer and much more comfortable around my grandmother. As far as I’m concerned? She’s my mother. 

Over the past year or so I think I’ve been getting worse. I very obviously have a stress issue (which my family denies by telling me I have nothing to be stressed about aka “get over it), the smallest things irritate me. I have breakdowns where I’ll sit and sob, particularly after my mother has gotten stressed/mad at me, but quickly get over them within 10 minutes or so. I struggle to sleep and I have what I can only describe as social anxiety (that might not be it but that’s the best way I can describe it). I’m extremely forgetful, I move backwards and forwards from my mothers place and my grandmothers and I keep leaving behind small things like chargers or wires (for my Xbox). This is another thing my mother gets stressed at me over and tells me that it’s my fault and I have to deal with it, despite my grandmother offering to bring it, she lives less than 5 minutes away. I also struggle to find motivation to get out of bed, do school work, ect. I also struggle to concentrate on multiple things and can only really focus on 2 things at once when I’m playing video games/listening to music (quite honestly the only escapes I have). 

I think I need help. A therapist or even a person at school to speak to. But as I’ve said before, I have what can only be described as social anxiety and I break down when trying to talk about any of this. I’ve also had a bad experience with therapists in the past (TW: slight self harm) related to me scratching my arms when I was frustrated which has lead to me not trusting them. I also can’t really talk about my actual feelings to my grandmother or mother, they’ve told me I can’t feel stress before and I’m afraid they’d either exaggerate it or simply push it aside. 

I’m struggling, and I’m only quite young. I don’t want this to get worse but I don’t want help. What do I do? And is there a name to what I’m currently experiencing (regarding my forgetfulness, stress and breakdowns)?

I am 24, female, I've grown up having to deal with emotional neglect and abuse, divorced parents, one alcoholic parent and one workaholic. I've dealt with depression, both my own and my mums, I've looked after myself from teenage years and I've been looking for answers my whole life as to why I am the way that I am.

For the last (I wanna say) 8 or so years, whilst doing reading into the mental world, and talking with friends and others that have a diagnosis or experience in the area. I have long found a connection with the disorder of BPD (now called EUPD). All of the criteria seemed to make so much sense to me and I have since used that to explain my 'symptoms' to doctors.

So life happened blah blah blah, cut to a couple weeks ago when my ex-now-friend (who only recently received his own bpd diagnosis) informed me that he has also now been classified as autistic as well. Now firstly this is hilarious because all through our relationship he would joke that he thought I was the autistic one. He isn't the first person to think this either, a couple others have asked me if I have been checked for autism. 

Now, I have done minimum research on the subject in the past, I guess I didn't want to think about him and the others being right. However after my ex telling me this, I had that feeling in my mind and my gut that there was something here that struck a cord in me. 

The fucker was right after all. I've spent an hour going through different medical sites building a solid list of signs for autistic girls and i went into shutdown mode because it freaked me out at how fucking accurate it is!!!

I very likely have autism and it makes so much sense.

Today I spent most of the day feeling down thinking about how my degree in psychology is practically useless where I live because I chose it with the dream of going into research which is just not practical given I live in a very small country town with no research facilities. My partners sister rang her and was talking about how she was thinking about changing careers to a job I always thought might be a backup for me and she’s in no way qualified or experienced but still talking to them and may well do a short course and get a job and it made me realise that I’m putting all my energy into academia not only because I do genuinely enjoy learning but because I can do it from home and my anxiety is so bad I have been unable to hold down a job for over two years now. 

This is confounded by the fact that I’m in the process of being diagnosed with epilepsy and haven’t been allowed to drive and also that I’ve been recovering from anorexia (after ten years) but honestly it’s not these things that really hold me back it’s my anxiety and it’s so bad that I can’t be around people too long, I can’t sleep at someone else’s house and I can’t have anyone sleep at ours, I can’t catch up with people without my partner and when we do I am highly anxious and the activities have to be short, not involve food, and have a way for me to quickly get away. 

Antidepressants have never worked for me. I buy the self help books, see my psych, do meditations, buy anxiety apps, try to exercise more etc etc. 
I’m still afraid of life. I don’t know how to fix it. My life would be substantially better if I wasn’t so anxious and could socialise and connect with people, leave the house to pursue hobbies without a safe person (I love photography and videography), and work a job that would allow me to feel like a functioning contributing member of society (literally any job). 
My partner tries to reassure me that I do very well at uni but none of that means anything. At the rate I’m going I just see myself being someone with a lot of knowledge with no ability to apply it in any meaningful way.

After 16 weeks (16 hours) I was discharged, the company told me I'd have to get a new diagnosis to reapply and then would have to wait months and after that there would be a tiny chance I'd be able to work with the same therapist again. This was around a year ago, I haven't received any treatment since.

I don't even know what to say anymore, since my girlfriend left (almost 2 years ago), I've had nothing to live for. I was very mentally ill when I was with her, I can't imagine what I put her through, but she gave me a reason to get better, I was doing it for us. I don't really know how to do things for me. 

I've been suicidal since I was around 12, I first tried when I was 16. My life has been full of betrayal, infidelity, deception. Mum cheated on dad and both my girlfriends cheated on me. Once dad was single he would ALWAYS have \~7 girlfriends, none of which knew about eachother. 

I've spent the last 4 years living in a big city but I couldn't take being alone anymore, so I'm back with my mum, temporarily. But if anything, I feel worse. Now I have people around, and still I feel completely trapped in my own mind. 

Everytime I think about the next step I think about how useless doctors have been in the past, I need to REALLY know what's wrong with me. At different times I've been diagnosed with: Depression, bipolar disorder, GAD, SAD, OCD, anorexia and CPTSD, all within the past 3 years. I don't even know what I'm trying to make better, there's just no way there's that much shit wrong with me. I have some fucking deep rooted issues and the task of finding someone that genuinely wants to make that better is too much for me now, I've been letdown too many times, I'm afraid the next time will be the end. 

I have no friends I see in real life, because I have no personality. My personality has become a collection of my various possible mental illnesses and the various things I've learned about how to treat them, I just have nothing to offer. No passion, no desire, I definitely would NOT want to be friends with me, I'm not a bad guy, I'm just fucking boring. The things I really love are video games, maths and psychology/helping other people, but they're fading really quickly.

Byron (Reckful) gave me really a lot of inspiration and hope, I could relate a lot to him. The way he was trapped in his own mind, his requirement for constant reassurance, his unquenchable desire to be around people he loves all the time. His path to recovery lit a real fire in me, it made me really determined to also get better, to be in a place where I was healthy enough to acquire those people I love and that love me back, to live a life where I have a purpose, to not perform the unthinkable act.

And now, after hearing the way Byron's friends spoke about him, how all they could really do is delay his death, how there was nothing they could do to stop it, how they all knew but knowing was worthless. I'm struggling to see another path for my life, I almost feel empowered, I feel no pain writing this because I want nothing more than to leave this plane of existence, to join Byron is his Everland.

I'm really fucking suffering from a huge amount of suicide ideation, I don't even feel sad, I just feel like it's already over. I'm not exaggerating when I say the only thing stopping me is my parents and my couple of friends, because I know these people really fucking love me and I don't want them to go through what Byron's friends are going through. 

I really need some sort of divine fucking intervention because I'mma fucking die. And even if my life is worthless I know my death will be fucking tragic for the people whose lives I am a part of. 

Please do not link me helpline numbers, they are all objectively dogshit help resources for me. I want to go to A&E again, but I'm not emotional enough for them to take me seriously, I'm dead inside. Last time I don't think they would've taken me seriously if I didn't have fresh cuts everywhere. I'm not really sure where to take myself anymore, my mum doesn't understand mental health and my dad is very far away, and has dealt with far too much of my shit for far too long.

I’m a 16 year old guy. I’m pretty introverted (like 60-70% introverted), I’ve had pretty bad anxiety my entire life (socially and generally). I also have depression. I’m pretty sure I have ADHD and OCD as well. It’s hard for me to make friends, but even harder for me to keep the ones I make. I’ve never had a girlfriend. I’m interested in things that a lot of people aren’t exactly interested in (activism and filmmaking, for example). I come from a close family, but a lot of the time I feel like an outsider. I also feel self conscious about my body, my personality, and pretty much everything about myself a lot of the time.

So here’s my problem: I feel like I’m sinking, as you can read from the title. I feel like things will never be good for me. I feel like I’ll always have feelings of strongly disliking myself. I feel like I’ll never have long-lasting, strong friendships, or a girlfriend. I, a lot of the time, feel like nobody likes me and that people are only nice to me out of pity. I feel like nobody values what I have to say. There’s definitely more to all of this, but that’s everything that I have off the top of my head without making this post too lengthy. I, as you can obviously tell, need advice on how to feel better.

246,247,247sad,sad,"Honestly, like many people on here, I’ve just been having a very hard time lately. I can’t shake the feeling that everything I hold close to my heart is being ripped away one by one. I was facing some anxiety and depression before coronavirus was even a thing, feeling pretty hopeless and all but my boyfriend was really supportive and reminded me I’m not broken and helped me find a therapist through our school. My life literally seemed perfect on paper like loving family, great school, good GPA, awesome relationship, financially stable, but I was still so sad and I couldn’t help it.

And then once corona hit and I had to move back home and my boyfriend and I became long distance it’s like everything external started to go downhill too. My pet of 10 years passed away, my dad lost his job, my boyfriend broke up with me, and now it seems like you name it, everything I start looking forward to gets screwed up somehow. 

My parents are really worried for me and make me send them pictures of me eating to prove that I ate since I’ve lost a ton of weight, and they witnessed one of my panic attacks just last week, but I’ve been having them for a while. My boyfriend and I ended well at first but I was really sad because I loved him so much and he wasn’t sad at all... and I just got so unexplainably mad at him for that. I feel like my depression ruined our relationship because I would have episodes and try to talk to him about all the ways my brain was sabotaging me and he just couldn’t understand and had to leave. And that’s a sucky sucky feeling because he was one of the only people who was really supporting me, and when I got angry I went off on him and I feel like I ruined that friendship as well and he’s just going to think I’m crazy.

Lately I’ve had weird thoughts around suicide. Mostly this: I feel like my entire problem for all my life has been this obsessive need to please other people. And for that reason I literally could not kill myself. I couldn’t stand bringing pain to my family like that, and I couldn’t stand people thinking I was selfish that I had everything so perfect and still couldn’t push through life, and I’ve grown up religious so obviously suicide has some bad stigma around it there. And even though it might seem like a good thing that I can’t kill myself, it almost makes me feel more helpless. Because if I knew I could just end things and life could have no more struggles then at least i have that control over my life, but instead it’s like I’m letting everyone else control it and physically cannot take my life into my own hands, not to mention that now it seems like that easy out isn’t possible and I’m going to HAVE to do life the hard way. Just feels very hopeless. 

I know that’s probably a bad thought to have and I’ve been trying to find a therapist around my home but since I’m working 40 hours a week and now my dad lost his job and we can’t afford anything expensive, it seems so impossible. 

Idk, it just sucks that I have these thoughts because I feel like depression will be so much baggage in whatever relationship I have from now on since it already made this very supportive guy that I loved so so much run away. And even though there shouldn’t be, there’s just such a stigma behind mental health problems and I’m afraid no one’s gonna wanna marry “depressed girl who has to post her suicidal thoughts on reddit because she doesn’t have anyone else who will understand”

247,248,248sad,sad,"Hi. I just need to vent as I can’t in to see my psychologist as it’s the middle of the night and I can’t talk to my family. 

So, tonight at around 9:30, I was on my way to dropping a friend home when we came across a car that had hopped a round a bout and two cars with hazard lights on. I being a trained first aid personnel pulled over to check if everything was okay. Lucky I did because no one else on scene was first aid trained. Unfortunately the driver who had jumped the curb had apparently not remembered doing this and their head was hurting quite bad. I remained calm and I communicated with the people on site, told her to not move or get out of her car as there was no sign of danger, and called the ambos. 

I relayed all the information to them while having someone keep her calm. We were close to the police stations anyway, a one minute drive, so a cop turned up in about three minutes after the call. The ambos then arrived with two more cop cars. We gave them all the information we knew and was told by the ambos and coppas that I did everything exactly to how it should be done, that my first aid training had paid off and I executed it perfectly. 

I dropped my friend off, and talked to her parents about what had happened and why we were late. I told her and her parents to watch herself for the next few days and to talk to someone if they need to. After dropping my friend off, the shock of everything started to hit me. I called my young adults pastor and just told him what had happened (as we had just left from a young adults event) and that we both were safe. 

Now that I am home, I can’t stop thinking about the accident. I know I did everything correctly, but I feel terrible still, like I’m guilty somehow. I’m all fidgety, anxious, been having spouts of panic, small crying episodes, dizzy, faint when standing, and my movements are all jerky.

I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and RAD (reactive attachment disorder) in the past two months and my depression and anxiety had mostly cleared up with the help of therapy.

The reason I feel like I'm at such a loss is because I was totally miserable my entire senior year, and after a lot of talking it out and through some perseverance I finally left what was the darkest place I've ever been in, lost 25kg, got accepted into University, made a bit of money with my investments, but ever since I just feel like I can't get as good of a mental handle on things like I used to.
Not to sound conceited but I've always had naturally good reflexes and a knack for being quick on the uptake and I've noticed that I'm not just slower, but I'm straight up not reacting to things anymore, from simple things like catching an item that I'd dropped, to way more severe things like not reacting at all to the fact my car hydroplaned and I crashed off the road with my best friend in the car (Both OK luckily,[minor crash](http://imgur.com/a/NMOkH2N), write off sadly).

And it's just starting to make me feel like something broke in me and there's a serious underlying issue. I'm not even sure how I'd approach a professional on this either, I just feel defeated and really dont want to get stuck in the spiral again but the more I feel like I've dissociated the worse I feel, it's like I'm losing touch with myself. It feels like I get through every day on muscle memory alone and that I haven't thought/been consciously aware of a single thing I've done all day.

I’m sorry, I don’t want to post a story that’s upsetting but I’m in need of support. 

A couple of days ago, I saw some horrifying things and I don’t know how to cope. I live in Texas. 

I live in a high rise apartment building. I woke up around 8:30am and got up to walk my dog. As I’m exiting the elevator in the lobby, I noticed about 4 cop cars roll up. I walked outside and I could tell something bad was going on. I could see a group of people gathered about 4 yards from me and I just couldn’t stop thinking “please don’t let this be what I think it is”. I quickly walked my dog and as I headed back inside, I saw a body with about 5 people around it trying to resuscitate it to no avail. 

About 2 minutes after I got back home, the police knocked on my door and had about 10 officers scour my apartment and question me after they told me they were looking for the balcony from which “an individual jumped”. After that, they knocked on my neighbor’s door and nobody answered. They had to break in with guns in their hands. Though I knew my neighbors were out of town, it was still very unnerving. 

I decided to go out an hour long walk to calm down. I cried, I tried to process. For context, I had a family member commit suicide when I was younger, so this topic hits really close to home. When I walked back, I figured the body might have been moved or at least covered. It was not. He was just there, uncovered, with no one around him. Dozens of cops were in the lobby. I was angry and confused and so much more. He was there for hours. 

I recognize what I’m going through is NOWHERE near what this man and his loved ones had and have been going through. What I saw, however, was horrible. I have GAD and this has drudged up some really shitty memories and feelings. I’m not depressed nor am I thinking about hurting myself or anybody, I just don’t know how to cope. What’s a healthy way to process something like this?

I've really struggled with my mental health primarily in the last two to three years.

# Background

*The Beginning:*

I had utilized my university counseling resources before but there was a limited number of sessions you could go to (which meant I wasn't able to go as consistently as I needed), and the therapist that helped me the most, was no longer there. I had tried other people through the university but they weren't able to help me, which made me feel more helpless, so I stopped trying to find another counselor. (I probably haven't been to therapy in at least 1 year).

*More recently (ish):*

At the beginning of this year, I got health insurance for the first time in a few years, under my parent. I also experienced one of the worst mental health lows for me, so I decided to take advantage of the health insurance, and finally get a professional opinion on what my diagnosis could be, so I could get better. My previous university counselor/ therapist thought it was Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I had suspected I suffered depression also (ran on paternal side of family). I found a psychologist that was in my insurance network and decided to make an appointment. (I thought psychologists could diagnose AND prescribe medicine, which I was looking for since I was at my end and just wanted to try every solution, not discounting medicine as I had in the past). Over 2 or 3 sessions, I received my report and was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and severe ADHD. My report was mainly about ADHD, as that was his specialty but I couldn't care less. I wanted help with my depression and anxiety more than anything. I went to a primary care doctor to hopefully receive medicine, since a psychiatrist was going to take longer. I was prescribed with generic zoloft and oh WOW! this was amazing for me. I hadn't felt close to my 'normal' self like this in YEARS. With my mental health issues in these last years, I've been known to be an EXTREMELY sensitive and emotional person... Even the mention of a topic of any of my stressors would be cause for an immediate breakdown (for ex. ""how's school going?"" my response: immediate waterworks). Or anytime I watched something, like something slightly happy happening to a stranger, or someone slightly talking about a past issue they had, I would just start crying. I'm an extremely empathetic person too which sucks cause I feel everything to my core. Anyway, this medicine helped me not be so highly reactive which I enjoyed!

*Present Day (resource journey):*

I am highly in support of therapy and medication, at least for me. Unfortunately even with the medication in the recent months, I am still struggling. My insurance apparently had not been policy yet so my psychologist and doctor visits had billed me personally and I pretty much owe about $4000. With the pandemic going on and other circumstances, I've basically had zero income coming in this year, so this has been an extreme stressor for me also. So with this being said, i don't have access to any professional help because i cannot financially afford any more, since I'm still in the $4000 medical debt (plus other debt but that's beside the point). I have 4 pills left of my medicine and I cannot ask for another refill, as my physician wanted to see me for an appointment again before she refilled. (Again, cannot do this as I cannot afford a doctors visit). I have about 2-3 weeks of a generic prozac that i first started with but ended up not using, as we switched me to the generic zoloft. i'll probably take these until they finish because I feel like something is better than nothing.

*Present Day (emotions, coping, etc.):*

I think I mentioned it prior but my coping mechanism is avoidance. So for MONTHS now, I haven't spoken to *any* of my friends. The messages come in but I ignore them because I don't want to put any of this on this. I think a lot of the answers to this question is to reach out to my friends and I know I need to because they're really starting to worry about me but I don't want to be like ""hey sorry i've been ignoring you for 28392243 days but I've been depressed and here are all my issues."" It's overwhelming for me to handle all of this so I cannot even imagine giving them this information to handle, especially with all of the awful events that have happened this year. Basically there has been a lot of sadness and struggle for everyone this year and adding my issues to their list is not something I want to do. I have a long distance bf who I talk to quite a bit but not about these issues largely, as he's not someone who handles serious issues or whatever well. Also no one in my family knows about any of my issues because my family and I don't talk about things. So basically I don't really talk to anyone lol :/

&#x200B;

# Conclusion (kinda):

Anyway, I'm sorry if this is so long. I tend to over explain myself but also feel like I left a lot of holes in this story, and I tried to organize it so that it was easier to follow but I probably made it more difficult but hopefully someone is able to follow along slightly.

I need help. I do want to say that I have not ever experienced suicidal tendencies, which I am thankful for, so that's nothing I have to worry about right now. But I've been failing at every aspect in my life for so long now and it's extremely overwhelming for me to handle. Therapy and medication have been the BEST solutions for me in this journey but I don't have the financial means to seek these resources right now. What can I do?

263,264,264sad,sad,"Hi, since college days I've been struggling on my habit of binge internet everyday and it get worse on weekends. During workdays days I managed to get around 6-7 hours of sleep but on weekday sometimes I only got 5 hrs of sleep, sometimes if I'm lucky I get around 8 hours of sleep, btw I live in noisy neighborhood almost everyday construction noise are always persistent, loud edm music, hill song etc, noise mostly starts at 7am. Catching up sleep on weekends is a struggle as well.

 I tend to have a habit of binging on Netflix, memes, socmed and games even on workdays, but it gets worse when its nearing end of the workday. I dunno I tend to act like a teenager when it comes to my sleeping habit, I have not so consistent sleep schedule on weekdays I tried to get at least some 6-7 hours of sleep, I tried to sleep before 1am but anxiety always get me awake at night, thinking about work, awkward conversation, past mistakes, existential dread, self loathe. Then on weekends I struggle to follow that not so ideal sleep schedule but I end my binging on same hobbies around 2 or 3 am worst 4 am, hence fucking up my bad sleep schedule more. I tried to use apps to manage my sleep schedule/anxiety but every time I finished a course example 1 month better sleep course I tend to spiral out of control again, I tried to journal everyday but I stopped, maybe because I was in stressful week at work, to forget the struggles at work I binge on same hobbies, it's been a week now since my last journal entry. 

My sleeping pattern/habits is now affecting everything from work, to family, even friends, takes noticing I've become irrational, irritable, out of focus, snub etc, worse are poor decisions at work partly brought by the lack of sleep. Also my dark humor has intensified maybe a coping mechanism to my failures. Also I struggle to learn my attention span is now of a goldfish. What's worse is that I have to learn new things almost everyday at work, working at it where learning new things, trainings are a must to keep up with technology, I hardly learn something.

 I cringe on the quality of work I did, I felt like I'm the bad apple in the office, the weakest link, the slowest to learn or the one who couldn't follow instructions or do decent report/presenting. On health I'm now hypertensive, easily forgetting (I sometimes joke to friends that dementia has set in)

268,269,269sad,sad,"My lovely panic attack started today just before we got to my partner's parents house, where we were meant to be having brunch with them, his three brothers and wives/children. While I get along with his family, I am very wary of his two younger (twin)brothers, who are self-satisfied, rude, and obnoxious. They tend to expect things to go their way basically all the time. I'm not the only one to think this either. 
Anyway, in the start it was a mild attack, but then as his brother greeted us by tapping his watch (we were cooking bacon and eggs for everyone) I lost my head and had a go at him. Needless to say, I was judging myself heavily for that and it made me more anxious. 
While I was cooking, I became incredibly anxious, and could barely talk to anyone, or look at anyone because I was on the verge of years the whole time. Which was great, just as one of the younger brothers and wife announced they were having another baby. I knew this was coming, because they never organise family get togethers unless they have some other reason. But while it's a very joyous moment, I couldn't muster the false happiness that I should be feeling for them (middle of a panic attack, I'm also sick of everything they say and do being about babies, and also, my partner and I are putting off children for a little while, which makes me sad). I couldn't deal with this news and while I managed to hold it together, I also felt like a fraud with a very fake congratulations.

I’ve always had depression and suicidal ideation.   It became the worst it’s ever been when I started teaching.  I never feel like I’m good enough for my job.

282,283,283sad,sad,"Hello to whoever is reading this. As title says, I've been dealing with some....disturbing thoughts.
First of all, I don't have too many issues atm, even with quarantine, I've got family, friends, a home, videogames to play, anime, movies etc...

What I'm really worried is about my future, my goal in life, my ""purpose"". I feel like I've wasted too many years in university trying to find a good career. After 4 years of nothing, I decided to study Radiology in a private school.

Fast forward, I study and go to medical practices and suddenly, I messed up a few times. (Wont go that much into details, but it costed the hospital some money) It's because of my weak and shy personality that I end up getting behind the rest of my classmates.
I could have graduated 2 years ago. It's just that I had...a breaking point, and got really depressive. It got worst last year, so I went to a specialist to talk about my insecurities, until she ignored my messages.

I can't be sincere with my family. Even though it's only my parents and older brother (who turned 30 two days ago!).
I would be putting too much pressure on them.

The thing is, I didn't do anything remarkable in quarantine. And next week I probably have to do my final thesis which I know it'll suck because of this way I'm feeling. 

Yes, I'm considering suicide, at my 26 years of life . Or rather, I'm feeling suicidal because I fucking hate myself. Of what a pathetic and hollow person I've become.

Earlier this year, I tried to end it all, even wrote here on Reddit on r/depression on another account, on how even after all, I was feeling better. And I've got to talk to some good people, but guess that! I never logged again, end up making the same mistakes and feeling guilty for ghosting them.

I don't...know why I changed that much. I used to be a happy girl. Now the idea I can be happy seems distant. And it really scares me.

I want to stop feeling guilty for every little thing that I do. I want to try and love myself! That's why...atleast I wanted to vent here a bit.

Even though I don't have any severe traumas or any dark past, no one should feel alone, or worthless.

Next week it's going to be decisive for me. I still need to study...

I know that my story is not that urgent.  I hope other users get the support they deserve. I guess I'll just stick here for a while.

I'm currently in college but have been on summer break. I haven't even done much this summer due to quarantine (among other things) and despite all that's been happening, I feel like everyone around me has somehow managed to make good use of their time while I've sat in my bedroom depressed for most of the summer. 

College itself has just been one gigantic mistake for me tbh. I've always been book smart so academics was never a big problem, but I'm struggling with everything else that comes with college. My parents and family always insisted I go to college because working minimum wage isn't really viable and at the time it sounded like a good idea and if I could handle the academic side I figured I could handle everything else but boy was I wrong.

My parents have never really been that involved in my school life besides occasionally signing off a permission slip or whatever else I needed, which basically means I've been in charge of handling the school side of things for as long as I can remember. They've never even checked my grades. But now I'm realizing that I really wish they'd been more involved to help me make decisions cause I'm young and I keep fucking up every decision I make. 

My fam has never been to college (except my gma but that was so long ago) so they didn't help me with SATs, ACTs, and choosing a college at all because they said they didn't know much about how it works (which is a shit defense might i add because how is a 17 yr old gonna know much either when this is their first time doing all this too).

I ended up choosing a hella expensive college without thinking much about it. I figured I'd just pull out some student loans since my piss poor family wouldn't be able to afford it and the school had already given me a scholarship so at the time it didn't seem like that big of a deal. Plus, my best friend was going to the same school which was a big win for me since I wouldn't have to worry about finding a roommate. 

The icing on the cake is that i have pretty bad social anxiety. It's gotten WAYYY better since high school mostly because I started going to therapy for junior and senior year to work on my anxiety and depression (i had already attempted suicide back when I was 15), but it's still pretty bad. Everything I do is dictated around what my friends do because I struggle to do things on my own. Phone calls are my literal worst nightmare and even though I'm almost 20 my mom still makes a lot of my important calls. Trying to find an internship is nearly impossible because I'm too afraid to even reach out to people so I already feel like i'm lagging behind my peers in that aspect. The only reason I even managed to get a job at school was because I went with my friend to the job fair and I wouldn't have even gone if she didn't go first. I've definitely managed to do some things on my own which I'm kinda proud of but I'm still too far behind everyone else for it to matter much. It's hard when everything in college is dictated by connections and social interaction.

So now, not only am I gonna be in a huge amount of debt when I get out of college, but there's no guarantee I'll get a good job because I struggle too much to even make good connections and land interviews. 

I know it isn't good but all I do is constantly compare myself to my friends and classmates and think about what they must think of me. When they hear about how little I did this summer I stress about whether they think I'm a failure or not. I wonder if they judge me for not being as good as they are and it's driving me deep into depression.

I constantly feel like a disappointment to my family and wonder if I should have been born in the first place. All I've left them with is huge financial burden and nothing to show for it. I feel like my only escape at this point is to kill myself because the debt is going to follow me forever which means I'll most likely be broke for the rest of my life, and I can't seem to escape from my mental illness which has ruined my life before it even got much of a chance to begin.

*New Daily Persistent Headache or* ***NDPH*** *is type of headache in which patients report chronic tension headaches or migraine almost every day and there is no specific treatment for it. It can last between several months to several years or even forever. The cause of this headache is not known yet. It can severely affect the quality of life and cause concentration problems. Very less research has been carried out related to* ***NDPH****.* 

I first started experiencing this headache when I was 14-15 years old (I'm currently 19). This headache had affected almost every part of my life, from academics to social life. I lost my ability to concentrate. I used to be a brilliant but became an average one. I couldn't think properly. I struggled with every activity that required cognitive abilities. I found it difficult to sleep at night. The headache feels like a bomb in the head that may explode anytime. Painkillers don’t help. I even forget daily routine tasks. I can’t even sometimes understand the simplest things. I never got a good **GPA** due to it. My hard work never gave good results. I began procrastinating because the harder I tried to memorize something or solve some complex problem, the headache just got worse.

People used to make fun of me for being dumb, having cognitive issues and unable to understand the simplest things. They said I was stupid.

I really didn’t get the life I deserved because of the **STUPID** headache.

I've had this feeling for a few years now, but it's gotten a lot worse during this year because the world seems to be on a downhill and everything is moving into sickening direction. I daydream everyday about how I'd just put a rope to the ceiling and get a stool and just choke to death.

I'm 25-years old and I feel like I've failed in my life miserably. I'm not productive, to be fair, I haven't done anything productive ever. I've always taken the easiest route and it's no surprise that I'm unemployed and have no education and no plans for the future. I hustle things here and there, leech of my friends and siblings and collect welfare to get by. I'm from a welfare state and it's a very shameful thing to be at the bottom of a society when you're living in a welfare state. My whole family is at the bottom of the society and it's always been like this. But, I have had every possibility available for me, but still I haven't done anything with my life. I cannot use my poor upbringing and the neighborhood I came from as an excuse because the education, healthcare and etcetera are free here. I'm a failure, that's the harsh truth and there's no denying that. I've always felt dumb and now I know that to be true. I used to have optimism but it's all gone now after watching these years just pass by and nothing changing. I've tried but never enough, I'm not capable enough to try enough to succeed over the ones who are naturally more talented and capable than me and have had a head start in life.

It seems like my future is written. It's either that I continue doing nothing and just use all sorts of escapism to make my life tolerable or get a low paying job which I will hate and do it for the rest of my life and live somewhat respectable life. That low paying job is behind of a lot of work for me because the employment in my country is so fucked that nobody will hire anyone who's my age and has no work experience so that option feels like too much effort for the reward. I had such big expectations when I was a little younger but the reality slapped me hard to the face and I've only realized that I'm average at best and probably below average most of the time and there's no way I can ever do anything of significance in this world. I cannot ever make my family or friends really proud which I've always wanted to. I constantly ask myself that what's the point in living if you are of no value to society and to the greater good. Sure, my family and friends may get some joy out of my existence but it doesn't change the fact that I'm an spineless excuse for a human being and that I do nothing productive.

I want a purpose in life and I want to show an example to my younger siblings so that they don't have to end up like I am now or like how most of my family have. But, what kind of purpose can dumb fucker like me have in this world? If I'd work hard, I could come your below average working class citizen, but I know that I'd hate everyday that kind of life. I'd be fine in some professions, but I feel like I'm too retarded or socially handicapped for every profession that I would actually like to do.

I'm trans and off the hormones that made me feel like a human being for the first time in my life, because my body couldn't handle it. I have broken bones in my feet and can't walk, but also can't use a wheelchair because of instability in my back that pulls my spinal cord & cuts off everything in my lower body when I sit too long. I can't have any surgery to repair my feet because I have full-body lymphedema, & they've been broken since March. I'm immunocompromised and with COVID, there's really no future for me. I can't avoid getting sick because no one will wear masks here, and I will almost certainly be one of the patients who dies of it, because I have intermittent anaphylactic episodes as a result of my trash immune system even without a viral infection. I've spent so long in the healthcare system & completely alone in my studio apartment that I think I'm losing my grip on reality but really, that reality has been permanently altered for everyone in the US right now. I'm just done. I can't keep holding out for a future for myself that doesn't exist. Every single thing I do to try and get better just digs me further into the hole and there are absolutely no doctors who will help--and YES, that is a fact, thank you, because being disabled means I am inherently worth less than a healthy patient. (I do NOT believe this about anyone who's disabled but myself. This belief applies only to me. Anyone who has a disability, youre fucking amazing & doing the best you can & you deserve to feel loved & connected & human & proud of yourself. I'm just too shit even without a disability to deserve that.) Further, being invisibly disabled means I am on trial, all day, every day, and that everyone I interact with has a goddamn opinion about me. Since I'm trans soon I will not be able to get healthcare because Trump wants to murder all of us. I have no deluded hope for this election to be any less rigged than the 2016 election, and I'm waiting for my name change to go through so I can hopefully get a new passport before they stop issuing them to anyone not cis, white, or straight. I was going to be a writer & a librarian. I was going to make art that meant something & now my experience can't be used for that, because it's something no one can relate to, & instead of humanizing me, it reminds people I'm not actually a person, just a walking disease in the wrong fucking body. Even if I manage to graduate college, I'll never be able to work, & disability insurance is only available to those who've worked 5 years or more, so I'll just kill myself when I graduate. I saw this coming years ago--even got my tubes tied at 18 because I felt like there was a war on its way, & I was right. There is no fucking hope for anything anymore. I even had to go and fall for the one person who's kept me alive this long, knowing there's no way in hell it would ever be reciprocated & knowing I'm not ever really going to be seen as a man in anyone else's eyes, even though I am one.

Pathetic and insecure outreach for someone to stroke my ego. Fishing for gems of wisdom in a sea of platitudes. Posting here is no different really. I accept full responsibility for the failure I am. All of my life's problems come from self-sabotage, laziness, and stupidity. I make impulsive decisions and hardly ever seem to learn from my mistakes. No real trauma. No real loss. Just existential dread brought on from years of poor judgment, bad psychedelic experiences, and looking at the worst of humanity through a computer screen.

Having a child did a lot for me. It gave me love like nothing I'd ever felt. It made me feel valuable. It actually got me off my ass and start taking care of myself. All of the trite bullshit you hear from every annoying parent. He is the only thing in this world that I hold dear. The thoughts would still creep in but until recently I would be able to brush them off with ease. Simply saying to myself ""That is not an option. You must be here. You must protect him. You must turn him into a man. Then you can die."" I still say this to myself but its starting to lose weight. Especially now that he is not in my life as much.

The situation with his mother is so ridiculously convoluted that I won't even try to lay it all out. Suffice it to say she took him and moved several states away. We weren't married and lived in one of the many states that favors the mother over the father. I didn't stand a chance. I had to fight tooth and nail just to be acknowledged as the father and was left with ""you can see him every other weekend and are going to start paying out the ass in child support."" Which doesn't even work logistically unless I live closer to them. I went to go stay with my father who lives about 7 hours away from them. I am currently trying to find a way to move to their state and start working there. But to say that this is an uphill battle (especially with everything else that is going on in the world) is a gross understatement.

I feel a strong need to be close to him. Because he makes me stronger. And because as much of a loser I think I am, she is worse. I genuinely fear for his future while she is the one responsible for it. But the defeat I feel from all of this is overwhelming and my drive to fight and do/be better is waning. So with all of the helplessness that I feel in this situation, the thoughts are back x1000. And they feel different than before.

I’ve been staying with a friend for a while, and my mental health has been doing so well. We’ve been getting so much done, waking up early to exercise and getting all of our work finished before lunch time.
I’ve had three meals every day for over a week now, and for me that’s truly amazing as I’ve struggled with eating disorders for nearly five years. Normally, getting (and keeping) any more than one meal down every 2-3 days is so difficult for me to manage. But three meals a day!! I cant even remember when I last ate this well! It’s been so tricky to build up enough mental strength to eat well, and I’m honestly not sure how long it will last, but for now I’m really proud of myself. 

I’ve been clean from cutting for about two weeks, I’ve only had five panic attacks in the last eight days (another huge accomplishment!), I’ve been showering and cleaning and taking care of myself and it feels so amazing.

343,6,6happy,happy,"I was feeling exhausted and burnt up all of June. I think the quarantine blues finally got to me. I was so tired I didn’t even want to brush my teeth some days. Was in a angry mood for a week, giving myself headaches from overthinking.

But today. Oh, today was a good day. I made a list of what I need/wanted to do during the summer. From exercising to studying, I tried to plan what I could do now to help future me. And to start it off, I cleaned my bedroom and washroom!! And I enjoyed it!! Played some YouTube videos while I dusted and vacuum. Threw out some unneeded items, put my clothes away. I was in a cleaning mood. Next is to redecorate a bit and I’m excited for it!

I was so worried that I would be exhausted all summer. Doing nothing but sleeping and regretting it everyday. But I did it. I did something that didn’t make me feel so drained afterwards. I just hope my exhausted brain can finally get that energy back :)",1.0,-73.0,-30.0,0.0,-15.0

It’s more that I want to share my real-life example of how that “It gets better” slogan can sometime be true. I guess I also just want to put it into actual words. Part of me still can’t believe it, but I’m happy.

My brother asked me the other day if I was doing alright, as I seemed a little short tempered to him. This came as a surprise to me, as I’ve been feeling pretty good. No, I replied, I’m doing pretty well. The thought stuck with me though, and the more I thought about it the more I realized it was true. I’m happy right now. Really, genuinely happy. I feel, for the first time since I graduated High School in 2007, if not “in control” of my life (which I’ve come to believe is a complete fiction, NO ONE is “in control” of their life), then at least like it isn’t spinning out wildly like some Hellish, broken carnival ride.

I’m Bipolar 2, with GAD and ADHD for flavor. Of course, I didn’t always know this. My parents thought a lot of my emotional problems were diet related growing up (I’ve got some hypoglycemia, history of Type 2 Diabetes in the family…). They did take me to a therapist in 7th grade who I stonewalled for all six sessions. It wasn’t until I moved to the other side of the country for college that my issues became horribly, crystalline clear.

I couldn’t function. At all. I lived in the dorm but avoided my roommates or any other variety of socialization. I stopped eating. I did my best to go to classes but eventually I couldn’t handle that either. I stopped attending. I stopped answering my parent’s phone calls. I didn’t get out of bed. Those first two semesters, I flunked nearly everything. By the end of the year, I tried to kill myself.

The next solid decade was a rinse-and-repeat of depression, doctors, medications, therapy, lies, community college, awful part-time jobs, and a deeply felt, vicious self-loathing. I hated myself. I hated what an absolute fucking failure I was, what an idiot, what a screw-up. I thought I was a burden to the people around me. I wished I was dead.

It took me all 10+ of those years to learn how to manage my anxiety. I learned through trial and error which CBT techniques really worked for me and employed them regularly. I had to learn how to ask for help and, perhaps even more importantly, that asking for help wasn’t shameful, that I was doing the right thing for everyone by reaching out to the people who still loved me. I figured out how to spot the early symptoms of a depressive episode, and that alerting my support network and making sure I stuck to a dedicated routine would help me stave off the worst of it. I started exercising twice a week.

Over time --with innumerable stumbles, set-backs, and repetition-- I began to feel like I could manage my symptoms. Eventually, I went back to school. Last year, after a decade-long battle, I graduated with an BS from a small but respectable university. I almost immediately lucked into a good job in my desired field.

I started to feel confident again, and at 29 I started dating. I’d only done so a little before, always feeling like I was too “crazy” for a real relationship, like I couldn’t put that fucked-up baggage on somebody else, that no one would want a crazy girl anyway. But when I started dating, something unimaginably wonderful happened. I fell in love for the first time. I even told him about the Bipolar and the Anxiety, and while it was pretty rocky immediately after (man, did he ask some WTF questions, but that’s a story for another time), we sorted it out and he was an open and understanding listener. We’ve been together over a year and a half now. We have a beautiful, sweet dog named Finn.

So when my brother asked me if I was doing okay, it really hit me that, yes, I was. Things definitely aren’t perfect (my boyfriend's family, oh man!), but I finally feel like I’m doing okay. Like the future could be net positive, if not always easy.

If you’re in the dark right now and you know with absolute certainty that you can’t get out, I just want to say that you’re not Nostradamus and no one can know the future. It might take longer --much, much longer-- than you’d like, but you can climb out of the dark place. If that sounds like pie-in-the-sky, then, trust me, I’m as surprised as you are to find out it’s not.

We talked about video games, weird things and other stuff like that. He just returned to his computer and asked if i still played TF2. I said yes. He asked me if i wanted some items. I was really happy, but didn't know how to respond, because i thought what he was going to give me was very expensive and didn't want him to lose money, but i eventually said yes. 

He then asked if i had Gmod. I don't have that game either. He said he could gift it to me. I was like ""are you crazy?"". I asked if i could recompensate him for it and he said he didn't want anything in return. I was shocked because things like this never happened to me before. 

He asked if i wanted Gmod or money. I had money, but not enough for Gmod and i didn't have enough money, so i asked for Gmod.

I thought it was just a joke at first, but then a new e-mail went to me. It said that person send me the game. I was like ""WHAT?!"" I never thought this would happen.

So my niece is turning three this August and it made me think to the first time she spoke to me.

They spared no expense to ensure they lived in a safe area however as a family of two they do not have a lot of money. The mom is a detective and the daughter is a chef that's unable to work in her industry due to a chronic ailment.

They have become somewhat of a surrogate family to me. Especially back then, my relationship with the people in my own house was not remotely good. It's been on the mends recently though. But they'd always make sure I was okay and that I was fed. They'd start watching a series with me and even though I could only visit every other day they would wait for me to be there before we carried on.

They would listen to me and really made me feel heard when I was feeling anxious and depressed and gave me the advice I needed to start fixing my life.

They still struggle with money and although I pay rent where I live and for food and medicines. I ALWAYS made sure whenever I went to their house that I'd take something luxury for them like cheese, chocolates, high grade meats and sneak it into their fridge.

Enter awesome kid (AK). he was about 8 years old, and had just seen me get out of the lake. the encounter went as follows:

AK: can you go swimming in the lake?
Me: yeah, the water is nice.
AK: is it against the rules?
me: no, nobody will come tell you off for swimming.

This kids face absolutely lights up when he realises that no park ranger is gonna be mad if he has a swim. so he runs off, takes off his shirt and shoes and runs into the lake at full speed.
My BF and I assumed that he had asked his parents if it was ok for him to go for a swim, regardless he was having the absolute time of his life whilst having a chat to me and BF.

mum, half laughing, half mad: OMG AK WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE LAKE
AK: those people said it was ok!

361,24,24happy,happy,"A little over 2.5 years ago I adopted our first dog, Kiedis, (think Anthony Kiedis of RHCP) a 2 year old Siberian Husky into my family of a 16, 4 and 6 year old boys. This was the youngest boys (4 and 6) first real experience with dogs. As such, they were a bit rough with Kiedis at first. They figured this horse-sized dog was a playmate. It was constant correction from me and frustration on the poor Kiedis. Eventually the boys learned to rough and tumble with one another and be gentle with the dog. Fast forward a few months later and we adopted another dog to help ease our naturally anxious Husky while we were not at home during the day. We invited Sirius into our lives, a 10 year old Cairn Terrier. Well, my youngest decides to pull an “Elmira” and was constantly trying to hug and pick up and squeeze our old boy, Sirius. It was back to constant correction. Until one day....
I would usually say “Don’t do that! He/they doesn’t/do not like it! He’s/They’re getting mad and may bite” My son would retort, “How do you know?” I would say, “Because dogs don’t like that”. It wasn’t working or clicking in his little mind. 
So one day after the 1,742,346th time of telling him to stop with the dogs and the same argument, “How do you know?”, I responded, “He told me”. This caught his attention. He said, “What did he say?” I then said something to the effect of “Get off me. You’re annoying!”. This brought instant amazement to my 4.5 year old and 6.5 year old that I could understand “doggie speak”. This evolved and I became a doggie translator. 
The dogs now have their own voices. My 19 year old got on board and also does the voices. Because Sirius is a Cairn Terrier, he naturally has a Scottish accent. Mind you, my imitation of a Scottish accent is terrible. And now whenever I use the “Sirius voice”, he comes a runnin because he has associated it with himself. Kiedis has a derpy man voice. I’m a woman so my low voice is atrocious. 
Even now that my boys are 6 and 8, they will attest that I can speak dog and translate with accuracy. 

Side note: Sirius has been known to swear, much to the amusement of the boys, which is his right as a 84 year old man in human years to his 12.5 doggie years. 
He also has a tragic back story that my 19 year old and I developed in jest. We adopted Sirius at 10 years old and don’t know much of his history. So we made it up lmao. 

My boys just got a new puppy at their Dad’s house and I fear our long ruse of being doggie translators will be up soon.  I know their Dad will not use the same flair for imagination as we do in our house. Ah well, it was good while it lasted! And who knows, the boys might play along since it’s so fun. This has taken a life of its own now. My 19 year old and I do the voices even when the boys are with their Dad.",1.0,-79.0,-90.0,0.0,-45.0

For a number of years, I taught in central Japan as an English teacher.  It was a lot of fun and some of the best years of my life.  One particular class I had was a bunch (7-8 I believe) of boisterous 5-6 year-old girls.  My height shocked them initially (I'm about 6'3"") but the defining moment was during a class.  There was a fly buzzing around the room and like most kids, they were easily distracted, so my hand shot out and I managed to snatch it out of the air (before releasing it outside).  This act cemented me as the most fearsome woman they had ever met but also green-lit that they could be a bit rougher with me.  They're a great class, if a little crazy at times.

Months later, I ended up getting an injection in my shoulder.  Not a big deal but the attending nurse wasn't exactly careful so my shoulder was pretty tender.  While kneeling during one of our many games, one of the girls excitedly shakes my arm.  The resulting wince and slight gasp brought the game to a screeching halt.  Within a second, they've gathered around.  One student lifts my sleeve and realizes (with a bit of pantomiming) that I had gotten a shot.  Youngest & Sweetest student dashes to the window, banging on it to get the attention of her mother, saying that she has to come in and kiss my shoulder because I was hurt.  The #1 troublemaker comes over to pat my hand comfortingly all while looking me in the eye.  ""Sensei, it's okay to cry.  Last time I went to the hospital, I got a shot too and it was very scary.

367,30,30happy,happy,"I believe this belongs here. This is a story from 2017 and is about the best birthday that I've ever had. 

Backstory: My birthday is two days before Christmas. My parents also divorced when I was 1 year old. When I was little I was allowed to have birthday parties with whomever I wanted. It was usually family with a few exceptions when I had friends come over for the day. When I got older, fewer and fewer family members would want to celebrate my birthday on the day of and opted to just give me gifts on Christmas with the exception of my mom, step-dad, and my youngest sister (my mom's daughter - I have other siblings but they're on my dad's side). Because of this, I am hugely opposed to people having to share special days either with each other (unless they want to of course) or with holidays. I am of the opinion that everyone should have their own special day. So every year around November I would start seeing who would want to do something for my birthday. My mom, step-dad, and sister were always among those who would and then I would bring whatever friends were willing to join me. 

In this story, ""my parents"" will refer to my mom and step-dad. 

Story: I met my current boyfriend at the end of October of 2017. He and I quickly became inseparable and he was and is my best friend. In November, my mom let me know that her, my step-dad, and sister were going to be going on vacation in December and wouldn't be back until Christmas Day and wanted me to watch their dogs. I was disappointed that she was going away but she said that it was the only time that they could get off because of payroll (she's an accountant). I agreed to watch the dogs and told my boyfriend what was going on and asked if he would want to hang out with me for my birthday. He said yes and we started thinking of fun things to do to distract me from my parents being gone. 

Come Thanksgiving, I got to meet his family for the first time. We hit it off extremely well. He had said that his grandma was rough around the edges but she and I got along great and their family was the most welcoming I had ever met. Apparently his family liked me back and they asked the next day if I'd be joining them for Christmas too. I said that I would do my absolute best to make sure that could happen. 

So the day came when my parents went on their vacation and I started puppy-sitting. My boyfriend came over and helped me as one of the pups decided that all of my yarn and stuffed animals were hers and tried to eat them. 

The day of my birthday came around and I slept in and then started debating what I would be doing that day as I'd had ideas but hadn't settled on what to do especially since I still had the pups to take care of. My boyfriend then asked if I wouldn't mind going to see his parents later that afternoon. We headed over there and I was greeted with the entire group from Thanksgiving - his parents, brother, brother's girlfriend, sister, nephew, and a little bit later the grandma. When grandma came in she was carrying a huge cake that said Happy Birthday on it. His dad made a wonderful meal and they all got me presents and sang happy birthday to me. I had only met these people one time before and they went out of their way to put together a birthday party for me.

Through basically all of the seventh grade, I sat in the same spot next to the pillar on the right under the overhang in front of the school library. After I finished eating I would go inside the library and help out. (mostly checking in and out books) I would do this just about every single day of the school year. Eighth grade rolls around and I'm growing apart from my friend group due to new member's behaviors. I quickly fall back into the same lunch routine. 

One day three or four months into the school year was one of the few occasions that I got a school lunch, I go to eat at the normal place and some girl that I didn't know even went to my school, was in my spot. I could not fathom why she was sitting there, as I always sat there. I can't explain why it was my spot, except for the fact that my entire time at that school I sat there every day. Being the socially awkward guy I was, (and still am) I sat next to the pillar on the left side instead and said nothing of it. We made some small talk and after I finished I went inside like usual and went about my day helping out. She was sitting there the next day so we talk a little more, I learned her name and that we shared similar interests. (reading, video games, etc) To my surprise, she was also there the next day and the next day and the next. Over a month or two we become pretty close friends. She introduced me to her friends and I became friends with them. Before I even knew it had a whole new friend group that ate lunch with me every day. 

Her childhood friend who was a grade above us didn't like me much until we participated in LARP at the local comic book convention and hit each other over the head with foam swords. The person who I met at the convention had a friend group that took my little friend group in because of the two childhood friends I still keep in touch with most of the larger high school friend group(we all still play videogames together) including the girl who stole my lunch spot. 

I'm still salty about it and give her shit for taking my spot to this day.

375,38,38happy,happy,"**So before I begin with the story, I would like to clarify a few things about myself, that will be of use to you guys when reading this tale of mine...**

I have a full-time job working in a hypermarket where you can buy your everyday groceries (hypermarket is above the standard size of a supermarket in terms of the store, sales and more..), and I'm working with a team managing our shop, where we all have each our specific area to take care of when it comes to literally everything from sales to ordering, set-up in the shop, talking to salesmen, looking at numbers for each week sales, and so on...  
I've got the frozen department of our store, which I don't really mind because I don't feel the freezing temperature upon my skin, as I can literally walk around inside our -20 degrees freezer without even feeling it, whereas my co-workers would instantly retreat outside to get the warmth back.   
But nonetheless, I've been working there for about a year now, but just recently within the last month I received the frozen department as the manager of that and got to learn everything to run it, and I've always been that kind of Fox to give our customers the best enjoyment with shopping as they go by our section of the store (frozen, dairy, eggs and so on.., basically the cold area of the entire store) which led to this incident, that happened on recently in May.

So on that Wednesday I restocking on my 4 frozen aisles with numerous wares, and in the present time that we're living in with the virus, it's pretty difficult to avoid people when you had literally hundreds of customers buying groceries as you're working, but as I was restocking fries, I saw an elderly woman who had trouble with walking around probably because of her age or perhaps suffering from arthritis in her legs in a mild state, I'm not sure. Though I couldn't help but notice her struggle to get anything off the shelves and in her shopping cart, and as time went by, and when she reached the frozen section in the store, she tried to get a 5 kg pork tenderloin box we had on sale that week, (there were numerous loins packed inside a plastic bag and then sealed within a box that could withstand freezing temperature), and unfortunately, she couldn't lift the box 5 cm above its position, so I decided to go over and help her before any rude customer rushed her by, or pushed her away to get the box instead of her (I've seen those of actions before). When I approached her, she seemed rather surprised as if she had seen a ghost or something. (pretty difficult since our work clothes consist of a red shirt and black pants).

(OL = Old Lady) (M = me)  


*OL: ""Hello, do you work here??*  
*M: ""I do ma'am, do you require any help? I saw you had trouble with this ware of ours, so I immediately rushed over to find out if that was the case""*  
*OL: ""Yeah, I was trying to get that heavy box up and in the cart, as I'm planning to buy it today""*  
*M: ""I see, is it the tenderloin you want?""* (I asked even though I already saw her trying to pick it up, but still, I wanted to be sure, as customers could have a change of heart)  
*OL: ""Oh yes, could you be a dear and pick it up and put in the cart for me?""*  
*M: ""Sure, that'll be my pleasure""* So I did indeed help her out with the box of tenderloin, but after having carefully placed it in the cart next to her other groceries, she didn't even hesitate to ask me for more help.  
*OL: ""Thank you, young man, I know you're probably busy, but could you help me out more?""* even though I did have my hands full at the moment with wares to be restocked, I didn't want to neglect the old lady, and it would also be shown as poor business service, so I decided to agree upon her request.  
*M: ""I'll gladly help you out""*

Little did I know that she had an entire shopping list to go through before heading for the cashier, but I wouldn't feel right to just refuse to help her when she clearly needed it, and throughout the list, there were multiple items that were quite heavy even for her, so I could see why she wanted the help. Some of the items were around 8-10 kg, and I imagined how horrific it would have been if she tried to lift a 10 kg item of a shelf when she barely could lift a 5 kg item, but after 15 minutes of us going around finding her groceries, I told her, that I had to inform my colleagues down at the cold section of the store to keep an eye on the frozen aisles just in case of restocking, which she didn't mind at all, so I phoned them and told my current whereabouts and predicament.  
As the minutes went by she told me everything about her situation with her husband, and how it was originally him, who were supposed to shop for both of them since she was barely able to do in her condition, but he had apparently fallen quite ill (not the virus) and couldn't leave his bed at all, and they were running out of groceries, so she had to step up even though it would be quite difficult, though she had hoped to acquire help from a worker within the facility, and that would be me.

Having finished the shopping list and heading towards the cashier, I decided to help her out more by getting every single item on the conveyor and even told my co-worker of the situation, and by my fortunate soul, a lot of other customers around us overheard what I was saying (even though I tried to speak very low) and gave me good remarks and compliments about the ordeal with me helping out the old lady. While she was paying for her groceries, I bagged everything in shopping bags (which she didn't have to buy because I was feeling generous and let the old lady have that extra goodness to make her day even better, whom my co-worker understood and acknowledge to simply not scan the bags for her)When everything was done and bagged up, I helped out her outside of our store with me driving the cart with all of the heavy bags inside, while she was walking right next to me, but I had a bad feeling once we reached outside, as she didn't appear to show me where her car was nor how she was going to transport everything back home.

*M: ""So where's your vehicle, ma'am?""*  
*OL: ""I don't have any since I can't drive anymore, only my husband can, so I took the bus here""*  
*M: ""I see, do you have anyone who can help you carry your groceries and also once you get inside your home upon arriving there?""* it's a bit odd question to ask her as a shop manager of a certain department, but in her state and with her husband being bedridden, how was she supposed to carry everything from here to her home.  
*OL: ""No one besides my husband, but as I've said to you earlier, he's currently very ill, so I'll just have to manage by myself""* I couldn't let that happened, it would be too much for her to handle in one way trip and even carry while being on the bus, so I came up with an idea on the spot that seemed rather drastic, but I really wanted to help her out.  
*M: ""If it's possible, would it be alright with you, if I talked with my boss to use my lunch break to help you getting home with your groceries, and also carrying them inside for you as well?""* she was completely stunned by my offer and didn't know what to say at first.  
*OL: ""But wouldn't that be a bother to you since you're at work, and I'm taking your time?""*  
*M: ""Not to me ma'am, but I'm going have to speak with my boss first, can't just leave my workplace without anyone knowing""*  
*OL: ""You go right ahead, young man, I'll wait here with the cart until you've returned""*

So I quickly ran back inside and head for the office to talk with my boss about the whole thing, and luckily since he's the best boss I could ever ask for, he agreed to let me help the old lady even more, and it didn't even have to affect my lunch break, and he would even inform my co-workers down at the cold area what's happening. So I immediately grabbed my car keys and rushed out to her in rapid fashion, as she was still waiting at the same spot I left her at.  
Upon meeting her again, a lot of other customers had apparently talked to her, since they found it very odd for her to stand alone with the cart and waiting for something to happen, in which she had explained the whole ordeal to them within the timespan I was gone to talk to my boss. So when they saw me standing next to her, they complimented me and said nice things about how great employees we were to our customers, so I couldn't help but feel completely satisfied with myself.  
I explained to the old lady the permission to leave my workplace to help her, and she was overjoyed and her expression lit up like a Christmas tree, so we drove the cart towards my car and stuffed it with her groceries while still keeping a seat available for her to be comfortable. I drove off with her directing me towards her home, and luckily it was only 10 min. away in the car, and upon arriving there, I helped out by carrying everything inside for her, while her husband was shouting from his bed about what the commotion was about, in which the old lady told him everything.  
It only took me a couple of minutes to unload everything and get it inside their home and after the last haul, she was utterly grateful towards the honorable deed I've done for them, and they would never forget it, neither did I.I even offered to buy groceries for them until the husband was fit again to do so, which they kindly took to heart and accepted, so we exchanged numbers, so they could in contact with me with details of their next shopping list.

Within the next few days, the store received a lot of attention from social media because of what I did, and my boss was beyond thrilled, so he gave me a 50$ gift card, which I could use in the shop I worked at. Last Friday I received a phone call from the old lady, while I was at work, who had a small shopping list they wished for me to buy in the store, and once work was done and I had bought their groceries, they actually gave me a tiny present, which I had to open when I got home. So once I got home and opened the present, there was a card which read:  
*""Many thanks for your generosity upon the day you helped my wife with everything, we never expected to get such lovely support from anyone during our situation, and for that, we're forever grateful, so in the present along with this card you're reading, is a small token of our appreciation for your hard work and helpfulness towards us, - Love Husband and Old Lady - ""*  
In the present were 200$ dollars and an experience card of my choice. (the ones you buy to try out a specific event such a traveling in an air balloon, having brunch in a lucrative hotel, and so on..)",0.0,19.0,-246.0,-50.0,-360.0

So two nights ago I started digging around and found out where her hair salon was and went off of that. More digging and I find a place matching the town and I decided to check that one out. The pictures somewhat matched but not exactly so I went on the all knowing Facebook and looked up the place that looked like the memory. I'm looking through pics when I find a video of the place I thought excitedly ""if she goes down that hallway and there are two chairs to the left and a row of them to the right this is the place."" And sure enough that's exactly what I saw so I sent her a message with my email and name explained that I used to know her son and wanted to get back in touch. Two minutes go by and she replies that she went through his papers and was about to email my mom and after that I started talking to Asher again and playing video games together and I hope to see him sometime this summer after five long years. I hope you found this story interesting and I want you to remember if you keep remembering someone reach out it might end up with a old friendship sparking again.

Note that I don't remember this story, my mom told me this recently, so the facts might not be completely straight.

When I was 4 yrs old, I used to have this Ben 10 watch (Still have it, just broken now) because I loved the show (though the reboot is something I don't wanna talk about). I was somewhere in public, like the airport, or the park. This other kid saw my watch and walked towards me. I think he was somewhere around 4 as well. He liked Ben 10 too. He and I were talking about the watch, but the thing was, he was French. I am from Africa and am only fluent in English, but I know a handful of Arabic and Spanish. Not French.  So we were just talking to each other, not taking in a word that the other was saying. We only bonded over the watch. My mom thought that it was so cute that I was playing with some kid I didn't even know over a watch.

383,46,46happy,happy,"Let me tell you about a story. This is something that forever changed me, and frankly, is the only reason my life is worth living. I was living my miserable life, working minimum wage at a three star restaurant. How I ended up here is not very interesting. My whole life had been a downward spiral since my senior year at high school. All it took were a few parties here and there, mixing in with the wrong crowd for a couple years, and getting a DUI. To top everything off, I got in a car accident. All of the carefully stacked cards that made up my life came tumbling down. It’s funny, isn’t it? Human social life is a fragile thing, yet it’s the most important thing you could get. All it takes is one mistake. Just one, before you are stuck in a hole with no way out but to grit your teeth and dig deeper hoping you might find something.

For me, I never found anything. Every Christmas, instead of having fun, I would cry. I would cry thinking about the fun everyone else was having, while I was sitting down on my couch all by myself, reminiscing on the times where life was bearable. I would remember the times where I sat next to my mum, feeling the warmth of the fireplace gently tugging me into a deep sleep, while the laughter of my family pulled me back. I would go to sleep on christmas eve and wake up the next day hoping there was something, anything, next to the fireplace. But just like every year, there was nothing. Not even coal. At least with coal I could light a torch and brighten the path that I dug out. But there was nothing. Nothing to keep me going when times were tough. Nothing to fall back on. It wasn’t long before digging was too exhausting. Reality kicked in, where no, you can’t just be whatever you want to be if you put your mind to it. Sometimes, it’s just too late to push forward, where you have overwhelmingly more risk than reward.

Just like that, I became a drifter. I wandered around, finding a place that I could begin to call home. Nothing mattered, but making sure I had what I needed to survive. It took some time, but after a while I was able to land a job, which I currently work at. It took even longer to get an apartment. The apartment I was able to get was a literal ruin. There were parts in the wall where you could see the frame of the building. Not to mention it smelled like the place itself was rotting. There were patches of mildew frosted everywhere. Deciding that the world didn't give a crap about my situation, and no amount of complaining was going to help me, I adapted to the place. Eventually, after throwing hundreds of dollars that I wouldn't ever get back, it felt more and more cozy. Slowly, as my financial situation improved, I could afford to think about the small things in life. Throughout this though, it wasn’t all roses and sunshine. As if life was telling me to give up, my dad died. It was labeled as a natural death. What is natural about having your parents taken away from you at such a young age? My dad was only 51 when he died of a heart attack. I was in too much pain to bear the outside world, so I locked myself in my room. I didn't come out until my Mom came over and practically begged me to come out. “You’re hurting yourself son. I get that you are hurting inside, but don't make that hurt yourself even more. Please”, she pleaded. I didn't care much for myself, but I couldn't bear to see my mom in pain, so I left my room.

Their deaths hit me hard. My dad dying was devastating, but my mom's death was what pushed it. She died soon after my dad did. The two days only months apart. I became lost again, finding joy in nothing. Everything was cold and dead. At this point, I went into a recession. I was already living on the edge, and now I was knocked over to the other side. The last time, I had my mom to pull me back, but this time I had no one. The other side was a weird sort of place. It was where it seemed like my body was on autopilot. I wasn't in full control of my actions. At first, I rarely left my room, only coming out to eat or use the bathroom. Life was the cycle of waking up at 3 in the morning, not being able to sleep, going to work, coming home late at 7, eating, and going to sleep. There were times where no matter where I was or what I was doing, I would have liked nothing more than to curl up into a ball and wither off into space, lost among the vast darkness. I would cry myself to sleep, drowning myself in tears of self pity. It felt like everything was hopeless, that there was no escape from the pain.

One day, as I was going through the long dull trek that I went everyday to go to work. It was so habitual that I could have gone there with my eyes closed. This time, it was different. As the road fencing ended, there would usually be two options for me. Take a left, and walk about another half mile or so. Then where I work is no more than 200 meters to the right. The other option is take a left, and walk about 300 meters straight into a dead end, with fencing at the end of the road, nowhere else to go.

Today, instead of making a left, I took a right. This time, I heard a voice. It was a deep, booming voice that made the ground under me vibrate. “Life is not free, so you will never get another chance. Except for this one. Come into the woods, and find the door if you want to get a second chance.”, it said. Now, it wasn't as if my body was being controlled or anything. Every step I took was deliberate. It was more as if I was drawn to it. I wanted to go that way. I knew from the bottom of my soul that the voice that promised relief from all the pain, a second chance, was honest. That made me determined. There was also something about the woods that made me uneasy though. My determination finally won over after some time, and I went ahead. The moment I stepped foot into the woods, there was an icy feeling in the air, and I shuddered with every step. The more I walked, the more I got that feeling of dread. At some point, after a long time of hacking through the woods with my bare hands, I couldn't take the dread anymore. I decided to turn back, regret filling my every move. Just as I was about to turn back, I felt a strange feeling. It was small at first, barely noticeable. As time passed I couldn't ignore it however.

It was my responsibility. I felt responsible for my own life. I owed it to myself to do anything and everything in my power to fix it, to become a better person. I slowly got angry at myself for turning back. Angry at myself for being content with this bland and pitiful life I had been living. Angry for not doing enough to help those around me. Anger at myself for not being my mom’s side in her last months. This anger is what made me keep going. The green forest was mesmerizing, with vivid shades of green, and bright colored fruits and berries popping in contrast. I was surprised. How was something like this unnoticed by any of the locals?

As I went farther and my eyes adjusted to the change in scenery, I began to notice other people. The more my vision adjusted to the change, the more people were apparent. It was like a huge sea of bodies. There were probably thousands. It was scary, knowing that so many other people wanted a second chance like I did. Knowing that this was a race, I sped up. The others had the same idea I did, and they did the same, and soon I was full out sprinting. It was a race, with a prize bigger than any gold medal. I was sprinting for what felt like hours, and some superhuman determination and strength overtook me. The burning of my calfs slowly fading away into another wave of intense pain. I was racing ahead of the pack. Soon, the thick wave of bodies lessened. I ran and ran. I ran until I was wheezing from the pollen, and then I ran even harder. After a while, I stole a few glances around me while running, and saw no one else. I was excited. This meant I had a chance at fixing my life!

*Bam*. I slammed head first into a plain white door. How had I failed to see this? It stuck out so much in the green surroundings, and it looked brand new, with none of the wear and tear you would expect a door in the middle of woods to get. The door emanated a sort of warm, positive energy that made me feel happy for the first time in so long. I don't know why, but I was completely confident that whatever awaited me behind the door wast a trap, that I would help me. With a smile plastered on my face, I opened the door, and it was the last thing I remembered from the forest.

I woke up, my head throbbing with pain. I looked around, but there was nothing but pure void. A loud, booming voice ruptured the silence, “Well, this is Ironic. You seemed the most angry at yourself, but you were also the one with the most determination to change. How interesting”. “Wh-...where am I?”, I stuttered. I recognized the voice. It was the same voice calling me into the woods. “You tell me.”, the entity replied. “I’m dead, aren’t I?”, I guessed. The entity laughed a deep warm laugh that made me feel warm inside, for the first time in forever. “No, you are definitely nor dead. In fact, you are more alive than you have ever been in the last 10 years.”. “What do you mean by that?”, I nervously asked. “You’ll see. Until then, you’re not going anywhere, life has so much more to give. Just try not mess up again, ok?”, the entity assured me. Just like that, there was nothing left but darkness. It was like this for a while, with nothing changing.

A blinding light pierced the dark.

The light was my whole life, everything I had done up to this point was all contained in that light. From the light, a line shot out. My lifeline, the one hting to tether me to the normal world and to bring me back. I had to get that, or I would die. Suddenly, my entire body was united, and with one purpose, to grab hold of the line. I ran as fast as I could. The line was miles away. I could tell it was, but it was my life. The same life I wasted due to reckless choices and self pity. I ran and ran. I ran for literal years. It was the universe's final way to test me. My feet pounded on the ground over and over with the same thud.

I felt my muscles tearing, my ligaments snapping one by one. My bones were crunching from bottom to the top due to the constant friction. My chest was pounding, my heart was tirelessly pumping blood, threatening to tear and brust any moment. After so much, my body gave out. My vision faded. The world was blacking out. I wanted to give up, to surrender to the cold darkness. It would probably be painless, in fact it would be much easier. But I couldn't go down without a fight, not like I had all my life. Not again. I slipped, tumbled, crashed, and stumbled. I never once did stop. I kept on going. The last 50 yards, I practically crawled. In the end, I made it. As my fingers touched the light, warmth burst through my body. My soul lit on fire. My fingertips tingled. I was alive.

I woke up in a white bed, needles sticking out me. Looking down at myself, I felt a strange feeling of deja vu. It hurt to even move. The light from the outside world blinded me, causing me to wince in pain. I looked through the window on the door leading out the room, and saw my moms face peering at me through the glass, elated that I was awake. Something felt off though. I overheard one of the nurses whispering, “Good thing his body is young, any older and he would have died”. Wait, what? How could they consider me young? I’d always considered thirty to be middle aged. Wait, hold up. I saw my mom through the glass... my mom.

There was one problem. She died. Wait, she also doesn't have stress marks on her face. She had it tough as well when dad died. Suddenly, everything fell into place. My mom being alive, her also not having stress marks on her face, the nurses calling me young, why I felt the strange sense of deja vu when I first woke up. This was back when I got injured while hiking with my friends freshman year of college. I had travelled back in time.

So, this is my story. This is where my story here ends, but also where a new one starts. A brighter one. I had an entity looking out for me, deciding through reasons unknown to me, that I was worth saving. It chose to give me a second chance at life. If you are reading this, I'm eternally thankful. You gave me what no one else has gotten. You gave me something more meaningful than anything money can buy you. A second chance at life. To this day I'm still confused as to the entity's purpose, but that doesn't matter anymore. If my life was important enough to be saved, anyones is. Never give up on your life. Unlike what happened for me, you only get one shot at it. Don't mess up your life, thinking it's not important, because if there's one thing this experience has taught me, is that it is. Your life matters.",1.0,-523.0,-296.0,-557.0,-555.0
384,47,47happy,happy,"So when I was around 11-12 years old, I was in a little rock band with a few of my friends. I played rhythm guitar, my best friend played drums, my cousin played lead guitar, one of my cousins friends sang, and another one of my friends played bass. We had a lot of fun playing together and usually met up at my best friends house because he had a ""music room"" with equipment and soundproof padding (his dad was really into music as well as his brother) the singer (she did have a really nice voice for her age) did not like are bassist, but they never really argued. One time, his parents were on vacation and we were playing a mix of Linkin Park and greenday most likely, because teenagers, and the bassist suggested we play killing in the name of by rage against the machine. I personally wanted to, the drummer and lead guitarist were down for it, but the singer didn't want to. So her and the bassist got into an argument and it ended with her winning because he didn't want to fight over it. When we all went home we studied the tabs for the song he wanted to play, in Wich he already knew. The next day we went back to his house and our singer decided she wanted to sing seven Nation army, so we prepped up and we're about to play. Imagine her surprise when she finishes the count off, and instead of hearing the white strips, she heard R.A.T.M. she got extremely mad and refused to sing, however we kept playing. The bassist was extremely happy. We probably should of told him what we were doing, because b
He started playing the song she suggested, but he quickly realized what was going on and joined in. Later on the singer left and we quickly replaced her with this guy from the school choir and we never really argued after that",1.0,-33.0,-22.0,0.0,-30.0
385,48,48happy,happy,"2.5 months ago I took a job as GM at a bar and restaurant. They had fired the previous manager and brought me in the day after my interview on the 4th of July, the BUSIEST weekend of the year for us,

Most of the employees I know and love like family now, were all about to quit because they wanted the old manager back. The moment I knew I became family was this:

Since the day I started I had this hard plastic reusable water bottle I carried everywhere. Because stay hydrated and protect the earth right!? And every day I made sure to tell my employees at least twice how valuable, vibrant, and wonderful of people they are. So one day I let my employees go early and closed by myself because they deserved an early night. I accidentally dropped my bottle/cup and it shattered into a million pieces in front of me. I immediately had to snap my distress to our work group in sadness.

Two days later one of my bartenders walks into work and hands me a Starbucks bag saying, “just read the note on top first.” The note literally said, “Ypu appreciate us so much, and we know how much you loved your mug. So we bought you a new one.”

I pulled out a black aluminum SB mug from the bag and proceeded to bawl my eyes out for a solid 20 minutes.",1.0,-6.0,-75.0,0.0,-15.0

Bed time rolls around and my kids are being kids. Bouncing around while I'm trying to read. We get through the bed time story and I am then attacked with a barrage of ""mommy"" every time I try to close the door. I get them settled and just as I'm closing the door my son pipes up. ""Mommy?""

""Yeah buddy?""

""I got a secret.""

At this point I'm just so tired and sigh figuring he's going to do like I do with him when I tell him I have a secret and tell him the secret is that I love him. Nope.

""Okay bud what's your secret?""

He giggles and lays down pulling his blanket up. ""You make me happy mommy.""

I paused for a moment processing and just smile. ""Thanks buddy.""

I then shut the door and sat down at my computer about to cry because it just made the entire drawn out day and my constant battle with my own issues while raising my kids completely and totally worth it. My son knows I struggle with mental illness. He also knows, because I cannot stress it enough to him, that he is not responsible for taking care of mommy in any way shape or form. That it is mommy's job to take care of him and his sister. So when he notices I am stressed out and/or depressed/anxious (and believe me I've had years of practice hiding it).

Okay. So. My SO and I live on the back end of a house. Shared parking is also at the back of the house. Also, it's nice enough right now that ALL of our windows are open. Now, our neighbors in the front are younger than us and all college women. One of them has a very sweet boyfriend who is always super excited to see and let our dog (who is super friendly and loves the attention).
Alright. So, this evening my SO and I are enjoying our nice and quiet reading time. The dog is napping by the glass front door, when the neighbors boyfriend drives in blasting some slow jam on his radio. Neither of us mind, since we're used to it at this point. He proceeds to get out of the car, the dog stands at the door staring at him, and my SO and I continue reading on the couch out of sight. Well, the guy gets out of the car half-heartedly singing the chorus ""When you say nothing at all"". Then stops at the sight of our dog, and whole-heartedly finishes out the chorus...to our dog. Both my SO and I are completely stunned and tried so hard to cover any giggles. But honestly, it was the sweetest thing. I'm a crier when I laugh hard enough, and by the time he had passed out open windows, tears where rolling down my face. It was precious and funny and just the nicest thing.

A bit of back story I work at a hospital as a patient transporter (I am the staff that moves patients and equipment around the hospital) and at my hospital transports also clean the rooms of patients that are transferred or discharged. About a month ago I was cleaning a room in the behavioral heath section of of the hospital and in my hospital we have semi privet rooms. I was cleaning one side of the discharged patient while the other patient was on his bed as he watched me but to me when I saw him he looked familiar but I couldn’t quite tell where I knew him from until he saw my name tag. He then recognized it and he asked me about it and if I went to a certain school and I said yes and I ask his name and he tells me and I recognized him as he was much skinnier, paler, and he was very different to when I last saw him and he was constantly shivering and shaking. He and I were extremely surprised to see each other after so long since we seen each other and he was extremely sorry for how he treated me in the past he felt guilty in what he done back then and I wont go into to many details about it here. I roughly told him it was all in the past and that I forgave him and all that happened I could see in his eyes that it meant all lot to him to hear those words we talked for a bit while I cleaned the room catching up and making small talk and when I finished up I reassured him that I am not mad at him I forgive him and though right now things are hard but I gave him a hug and left. 
A few days later I came when they were doing a visitation and I came on a day I had off and I surprised him and his mom was visiting at the time so i met her too and we talked more about life and I gave him advise. As I learned more about him as bits and pieces of why he’s there, his broken family, his problem with drugs, and history of violence and it hurt me to hear it as I comforted him and told him ways to turn around his life and in my mind I think it helped but as soon as the visitations are back I will try to see him again.",1.0,-75.0,-15.0,0.0,-15.0

Well, the reason I say ex boss is because she got fired. The whole crew quit after she got fired, and I was part of that. Recently, I've been hanging out with her and her family just because there's nothing better to do. But this one night, we were so bored and had nothing to do so we decided to get drunk and high. Our mutual idea while under the influence of both was to dye our hair. Me being more messed up than her led her to do my hair for me. I have never felt such love and care in my life until she put her hands on me. I was so drunk and high and had no recognition of what was going on. But what I was fully aware of was the way she was caressing my hair. After we applied the dye, we took separate showers and cleaned up. And whenever I asked her for a blow drier for me, she offered to help me dry it. And again, the way she was so gentle with my hair felt so warm and comforting. I can't quite place words for what I felt that night. But i gave her a hug and told her she means too much to me and that I would never wish harm upon her soul.

He was more on the popular side, I was more on the geeky/awkward people side. Our middle school had dances monthly and he’d come to do whatever dumb nonsense boys did back then, like running around or getting himself into something.  Eventually he had to move away and I didn’t realize for a long time. 

Freshman year passed and I had my very first, at least what I thought I had, high school sweetheart. The guy’s a douche. Left me over text. Then one night, my partner posted something he had a good question for. I slid up, answered it for him, and we started talking from then on. 

Over the next 8 months, we’ve had no idea what would’ve came to us. I thought he was temporary. He did too. We did everything together. He turned into my best friend, my protector, and my life. We did a lot together and we had each other’s backs. I didn’t know what or how someone should be treated until I met him, because of how toxic my relationships were my entire life. 

We learned a lot from each other. How to open up to each other. How to protect your own partner. How to take care of someone who loves you the same. 

A thing I noticed he did was remembering every little thing I do. Whenever I’d get upset, he’d notice I’d stay quiet for 2 minutes. He’d notice whenever I get happy, my smile lights up. He noticed when I’d feel afraid I’d stuff my face in a pillow or a stuffed animal. He also knows the sleeping position I’d sleep in.

As much of a total ass as he is, and he's a kid so ya know he is, he's also very loving and affectionate. My son picked up very early on(probably around 3yrs old) that some was off with mommy. I have sever anxiety and depression along with a whole goodie bag of mental health problems. I am medicated and was in therapy but can't afford therapy so yeah.

Him: ""You okay?""

Me: ""I'm fine mommy is just not feeling to good.""

Him: ""You sick?"". Note he knew I was taking meds just not why.

Me: ""sort of buddy. Mommy has depression and it's kind of like being really sad only it doesn't go away and mommy has a hard time just getting out of bed some days.

Him: ""You are depressed? Why?""

Me: ""I don't know buddy. I wish I did. Mommy's brain doesn't make the happy stuff so she takes medicine for it.""

Him: ""Did you take the happy medicine?""

Me: ""I did. But sometimes mommy just has really bad days.""

Him: ""Today is a bad day? why?

Me: ""For mommy it's just a bad day. I don't know why buddy. You know how mommy always tells you and you sister to tell her what is wrong so mommy can fix it?"" He nods ""Well mommy doesn't know what's wrong so she can't fix it. All she can do is take her medicine.""

Him: ""So the booboo is in your head? Like the headaches?"" (note I get really bad headaches and migraines pretty frequently.)

Me: ""In my brain but yeah buddy something like that.""

Him: ""You know what?""

Me: ""What's that buddy?""

Him: ""I wanna cuddle.""

Me: ""Really? Right now? Like literally every other time I want to cuddle you and you are a butt about it and you want to cuddle right now?""

401,64,64happy,happy,"So I have other posts and it talks about my son a lot more than my daughter. Didn't wanna be like I favor him more than her because I don't. She is 8yrs old. Developmentally and speech delayed and autistic. She can be a handful. Things would be so much easier with her if she could communicate. While her communication has gotten better she's still so far behind. But this story is from when she was about 4yr old. She barely spoke, mostly just screams and babbles. God forbid you try to hug or cuddle her because she was not about the cuddling life(her autism. For a while I took it personally and thought she didn't love me). She was not a very lovey dovey kid(still isn't really). And at this point it never dawned on me that she might be autistic. Her father just kept insisting she was fine and was just being defiant. His g/f knew some ASL and had the same feeling that I did about my daughter, that she actually had problems.

To set the scene. I hadn't met my current g/f yet. I wasn't medicated. Hadn't gone to therapy. Was still married and my(at the time) husband has his side chick living with us. I was in a dark place and at the end of my rope. I crashed and hit a low point, a place I hadn't been since I was pregnant with my daughter. I was sitting on the kitchen floor holding a knife in my hand. It felt like I was sitting there forever with tears down my face quietly sobbing. Everyone was asleep. I broke down and tossed the knife on the counter unable to do it(was still alone at this point) and just curled up and cried. I looked up for a second feeling like I was being stared at and saw my daughter standing there(sneak little ninja that she is). Now she doesn't look directly at people very often and never for long periods of time when she does. But there she was just standing there staring at me with this old soulful eyes. She walked over to me and I quickly tried to clean up my face and try to stand up only to be stopped by her crawling up into my lap and curling up there. She reached up her hand around my head and pulled it down to I was resting my head on her head. I wrapped her up in my arms and just cried. She sat there in my lap holding onto me and patting the back of my head. It was at that point I realized how much she loved me and that she just has problems showing it. I told her I loved her so much. She looked down at her free hand and carefully managed to sign ""I love you"" to me. I then picked her up and took her back to bed and tucked her in. When I tried to leave she ""squawked"" at me and I ended up crawling in bed with her and slept in her bed that night. Woke up almost on the floor the next morning because she's an aggressive sleeper like me but she's smaller lol.",1.0,-28.0,-140.0,-50.0,-45.0
402,65,65happy,happy,"Hi, I’m 16 and for my whole life, I never saw my father. I’m a single child and my mom and my dad got divorced before I was born. I always bring up my seeing my dad to my mom but my mom always changed the subject or said: “If he ever wanted to see you he would see you.”


My mom has her office in the basement and whenever she forgot something from downstairs, she’ll have me go down and get it. One night years ago (about 2-3 years ago) she forgot something in her filing cabinet. That was when I came across the divorce papers. I started searching through to find something about my father. The only thing I could find was an address. A month later I brought it up with her and she told me that the last time she knew of him was when he was moving down to Tennessee. So I kind of lost hope when she said that. 


I got my first phone in the middle of my freshman year. I saved the address on my phone so maybe I could go to it one day. Two weeks ago, I had my license for a while and so I told my self that I was going to the address on a certain day.


I had to find some way to not tell my mom that I was going to see my dad, so I made the excuse that I was going to be hanging out with friends the whole day. I didn’t know what I was getting myself into. The only information I have about my dad was from my mother, she said he was a lazy drunk who never helped around the house. Out of everything I heard about him, I still wanted to see him. I only had the address to go to, and there could be a chance he wasn’t there, but I drove over an hour to that location.


Every mile I made I was thinking to myself “What am I doing?”, but I kept ongoing. I was going behind my mom’s back which is something I never did. To give you a preference of how far I had to drive and the time I had to rethink everything I was doing, I live in a small town called Maineville Ohio, he lived in a small town called Verona Ohio past Dayton. That’s 1 hr and 16 min of me driving at the age of 16 going to a place I don’t know what to expect from behind my mom’s back. 


Once I got there, I knocked on the door and his wife answered the door. She said, “Hello, is there anything I can help you with?”

“Yeah, I’m 5 Elements. Is Mr. Elements here?”

She led me inside and opened a door to where my father was sitting on a bed. I said nothing, I just started crying. He got up and gave me a hug. All I could do was give him a hug. After a while, he sat down with me He told me his side of the story. He was working every day for long hours and rarely had anytime to be with my mom. My mom was in school working to become a teacher. He told me how he only sees her once a week, and when he was there, she’ll always ignore him, go out with friends or volunteer at various locations. He told me that they had similarities but yet different. He didn’t want to bring me back and forth cause he didn’t want to make me feel that he was only picking me up just because he had to, cause he grew up like that with his brother and two sisters. He knew that it was the best choice to leave me with my mom. That was when we both got each other’s numbers so we could stay in contact. I just have to keep him a secret from my mom.


Now I’m thinking to myself, what if I never went and took my chances of seeing him. I now have a whole new side of the family I have yet to meet. If I haven’t gone to that location I wouldn’t have known that Diabetes runs though my family, That I’m an uncle to my halfsisters kid, and I wouldn’t have known that he actually did still love me. ",1.0,4.0,-140.0,0.0,-240.0

i was on a small field trip with one of my elective classes and we had about a half an hour to spare so we went to Starbucks. my friends and i got out stuff i got a brownie and a cake pop since i don't really like coffee (yes this is important to the story). I saw a person experiencing homelessness outside so I decided to go out and give him the money we had left over. He said thank you and i went back inside. I then thought ""I should get this guy's name"" idk why I just thought it would be a nice thing to do and my friends looked at me with a combination of that's so sweet and why tho. so I went out and ask him what his name was and he told me and I said my name and nice to meet you. He commented on my name and told me it was beautiful. I went back inside and thought for a moment. I myself have this nature to try and be kind to people of course i am not angel but i felt as though i could do more for him. So I grabbed my cake pop and took a piece of paper and wrote him a note. As we were leaving I gave him the note and cake pop. He just had this cheerful shocked look on his face that i couldn't help but smile. He called me sweet and took the cake pop and we left. The note basically said how to not loose hope because things will get better. I hope that Dylan is doing alright and hopefully he remembers me.

409,72,72happy,happy,"Hey, so this is a pretty interesting and emotional story for me that my grandma has told me today. 
Trigger warning: Mention of suicide, suicidal thoughts, depression and dentists. 

My name is Robin and I'm 13 and suffer from depression/suicadial thoughts since about 2 years now. This is a story about how I kept my grandma alive instinctely. 

My depression has gotten worse the last 3 months, and I even was in a psychiatry. So now, I'm not allowed to stay at home by myself so I went to my grandparents. They don't live far away, so that's no problem. I had already spent most of the day there, with my grandparents and also my brother when he told me he's going home. He's 11 and we only live 1 block away so that's no big deal. He called my dad so he could open the gate (sounds a bit fancy but really isn't), and dad asked if I'm going too. 

It was around 7:30ish pm and it was already getting dark. My depressive thoughts are usually stronger in the evening, cause everything is getting dark and quiet and so I don't have any distractions (or at least not as much as there are in daytime) from my thoughts. Because I swore my therapist to tell somebody when I'm having bad thoughts I decided to stay. If I went home, I'd sit alone in my room and 'the thoughts' would have gotten stronger, so I would have had to tell someone, but my relationship isn't strong enough to tell my dad, so my grandparents are fine. And because of the fact that it was already getting dark, my grandma sent my granddad to come with my brother. 

So me and my grandma were alone and she noticed the thing in my eyes, you can only see when I'm depressed. It's when my eyes look so dark, that you think you can see my soul. Not everyone, nearly noone notices, but she did. So she started talking about the times she wanted to kill herself, not too long ago.

 Background story: she fears the dentist. You could probably call it a phobia but it was worse. She wasn't at the dentist since she was around 20. She's 64. She often thought about taking an overdose to not having this pain, caused by her theet anymore. She never talked about this with anyone. She was ca. 50 years old when she couldn't find anymore reasons to live for, and lost all hope. I don't know if she had already started writing farewell letters to her family. Guess she did. 

But then, I was born. My mom is from Germany and my dad is from Nigeria and wasn't allowed to come to Germany at the date of my birth. He was in Austria while my mom was in the hospital. She needed someone to drive her, so my grandma did. She was 52 at that point. And there she was. Standing next to my mom's bed while she gave birth to me. 

She told me, that she immediately felt a connection between us. And she was right. 5 weeks after I was born, my dad finally showed up. He didn't have a job or was responsible of anything. So my mom didn't allow him to babysit me. He didn't care. So I ended up being with my grandmother everyday, cause my mom had to work. Immediately after my birth she had to start working again. I didn't care who was there for me, as long as I got food and a new diaper regularly. When I came, the suicide thoughts of my grandma didn't leave. But she finally found a reason to be alive.

 For about 3 years she didn't have those bad thoughts. But then, when I turned 4 she was depressed again. I had gotten a brother, who was already 2 at the time, my mom didn't had to work that much because my dad found a job aswell, and I didn't have to spend that much time with my granny.

 But I kinda sensed that my grandma wasn't doing so fine, cause I didn't leave her anymore, at least that's what my grandmother told me. So she had 'the thoughts' again, but just couldn't do it, because she knew, that I didn't love anyone nearly as much as her. And she stayed. For a long time everything was good, cause my grandma was too busy. Now she already had four grandchildren. More much work, less time to be depressed (I know this doesn't work with everyone, like me for example, but it helped her). 

But then 1 year ago she started feeling like shit because of her teeth again. Now she already has 7 grandchildren. And I was her favorite. But  this time, I wasn't enough to keep her alive. She told herself:""You either fina-fucking-lly go to the dentist, or you'll kill yourself."" So she started researching. And she found it. She found a dentist for anxious patients. She couldn't even say the word 'dentist' without starting to shake. 

So she sent them an email and even told them about her suicidal thoughts, that the dentist had caused. But she did it. She went to the dentist, and told noone. At this point everyone knew, that she didn't go to the dentist for a long time. She never smiled, fearing she could show her teeth. She always spoke keeping her mouth mostly shut. She never encouraged any of her grandchildren to go the the dentist, when they were nervous because of him themselves. But the thing that broke her the most was the smiling. She had a reason not to smile, so it was harder for her to find a reason to smile, until it stopped completely. She went to the dentist. 

They had read her email carefully. I never knew that it was such a big deal to my grandmother until she told me today. After it was finally done, she called her children and told them. They told her that they were proud of her. I am too. She really never told this story anyone, especially not the suicidal thoughts part, except for me. Only because I was sad. I love her so much.

So I sit next to him and i here him “should I stay or should I go” and as a joke I started singing it with him and he was smiling and laughing, then the next day he’s sitting there and he asks if I play D&d and I said yes. So he gets all excited and went and talked about what he did in D&d for an hour and genuinely enjoyed himself, and this went on for a couple of days and he’s made weird remarks about “wanting to go to his uncles in Alaska cause he has a bunch of guns” and “you know there’s been only one school shooting in Alaska” which I can see what he was hinting at but I let him talk and then it was back to D&d, and over the course of the days he’s gradually stopped talking about shooting and has just been generally happier.

415,78,78happy,happy,"I found a men’s class ring while metal detecting with my sons. The ring is from a local university and dated 1965 with initials engraved inside the band. 

I posted about this ring on a Facebook page dedicated to lost class rings around 7:00 AM in the morning. A member of the group researched the JCU yearbook to find his name and then used a people finder site to get a phone number and messaged me by 7:30. I waited till 8:00 to call. A gentleman answered the phone and I asked for him by name. 

“This is he”

“Hi, my name is Mike Gibson and this may sound a little weird, but I was out metal detecting with my boys this weekend around the Chagrin River and found a class ring...”

I heard a slight gasp.

“I remember exactly where I lost it, we were climbing the rocks along the river.”

I heard joy and disbelief in his voice. I then began to realize this was real. He went on to tell me he didn’t come from a rich family so the $80 he’d spent on the ring was a lot of money. He did not have the ring very long before losing it.

“It is something that I’ve regretted my whole life.”, he said. 

So much so that he bought a replacement ring about 10 years ago. 

Now I am beginning to realize the opportunity to help teach our kids an important life lesson that they will never forget. I ask him if he would mind coming to our house for dinner to get the ring and tell us his story, he agrees immediately.

“That would be great, I would love to meet your kids and tell them my story.”

So now we have set a date for dinner on Saturday, March 7th.

We hugged. We cried. We sat and waited until the end of the service.  We went back up to *April and handed her every single piece of sugary loot we had gathered in that short time. Although most of us have went out separate ways since then, April and I remain besties. She still talks about that day. She says the only light she saw in the darkness was us. It came full circle 8 years ago when my dad died in a horrific explosion at work. Even though we hadn't really spoken for some time (estrangement due to drug abuse on her part) she was first in the line. She hugged me tighter than I have ever been hugged. She, like all our childhood friends some 30+ years before, took a seat, and waited.  She came back to me, handed me an envelope and left in tears.  The next day, I opened the envelope to find a young child's handwriting. Pages and pages of notes about her pain during her loss, and how her best friends' silent support was the only thing that carried her through. Sorry about the long story, but I hope this proves that the slightest notion during such heartbreaking times can serve to be the light someone so desperately needs to find.",1.0,-111.0,-15.0,0.0,-60.0

A bit of backstory before we begin: I have Dyspraxia, which I can best sum up as ""A appetizer sampler tray of developmental disorders,"" and this includes a few characteristics of Autism. I can get pretty easily overwhelmed at times, and so, around the time of this story, I would always bring a sketchbook with me to my high school to doodle in to calm me down.

Anyway, during this particular day, I woke up wayyy later than I should have (I usually get up at around 6:10, and on this particular day, I woke up at around 6:45), so I had to rush a bit to get to school. Take a shower, get some breakfast, get my backpack, but thankfully, I was able to get to school on time.
My first period starts. Math. Today we have to do a review on the unit we've been studying for a quiz. I'll just reach into my backpack and...

Wait-

Where's my pencil case?

Okay, I'll just reach into some of the outer pockets, and...

No pencils.

Wait... I usually keep my sketchbook and pencil case on my bed so I can get them in my backpack every morning, so if I forgot my pencil case-

*Oh No.*

I search in my backpack some more. *No sketchbook.*

Panic starts to set in. I'm able to borrow a pencil from the teacher to work on my review.
Before I start crying.
I usually have my hair (which is pretty long) down, so if I just look down at my review and focus, I can hide my crying. I'm also very good at staying quiet while crying. A few people notice me and ask if I'm alright, which I respond with the clichéd ""I'm fine,"" and people just go back to whatever they were focusing on. Soon the bell rings, and I quickly get my stuff and get out of the classroom.
Second period starts. English.
I get to class, and I put all of my stuff down to get ready for today; I get some tissues from the teacher's desk, and that's when she notices me crying. She asks me if I'm alright, which I respond with ""I'm fine."" She doesn't buy it, and she drags me out of the classroom.

""Alright, what's wrong?""

After a lot of stuttering and sobbing, I tell her a short summary of what happened. I always bring my sketchbook (and pencils) to school, I forgot them today, and my mom will be out of town for the entire day, so I can't ask her to bring me my sketchbook and pencil case. My teacher pats my back a bit, and tells me to go to the bathroom to calm down. So I do, I hang out in the bathroom for about five minutes, before I get back to class. I'm still a mess, but I look less like one.
But then I see it.

On my desk, there were five sheets of blank printer paper, and two regular pencils.

I never felt so relieved in my life, and my teacher was looking at me with a smile. Thankfully, I didn't really have to do anything that day for English. So what did I do?
I doodled.
And by the end of class, with the sheets of printer paper in hand as I left, I was back to normal.",1.0,-39.0,-45.0,-50.0,-75.0

421,84,84happy,happy," Last night I got in an accident that totaled the car I have owned for 17 years. Fortunately, I was okay. It wasn’t a super high-speed collision, but I hit was an SVU with a high bumper that hit squarely into my hood. It didn’t need a lot of force to do a lot of damage.

I don’t usually anthropomorphize my possessions, but that car was an exception. It had a personality to me, it had a character, and it had a life.

My mom died when I was 19, and my dad got me the car only a few months later. I didn’t want my mom to pass, but she was also abusive, controlling, and codependent. In a lot of ways, getting that car represented a freedom I had never had before.

I knew we were perfect for each other the day I got it. My dad wanted to get me a low tier convertible, because he thought it looked cool, but I refused. I wanted something I could afford to maintain on my own, and I wanted to attract friends that were down to earth, ones that cared about me not my car.

I also insisted on a key fob, even though those weren’t standard yet. I have ADHD and had locked my keys in the hand me down truck I had driven in High School more times than I can remember. But, I knew if I needed the fob in my hand to lock the door, locking it in the keys in the car wasn’t something I had to worry about any more. I also insisted on a standard transmission. I wanted a car I could really get to know, to learn what it liked and didn’t like, and how to coax it into doing things even it didn’t think it could.

There was only one car on the entire lot that had both those features, and it was stored in the back of the lot behind a few dozen other cars. I made them move all of those cars, just so they could get that special one for me. It was even Silver, just like I wanted.

That car was there with me all through college, which I not only had to navigate on my own with learning disabilities, I also had to build all the social skills I had missed out on in high school because of mom. But I dove headfirst into all those challenges, and that car helped carry me through.

It was also there for almost every outing with my Little when I volunteered for Big Brothers Big Sisters, which has been one of the most enduring and important relationships in my life.

That car went with me when I drove all the way to California just to see Radiohead, and drove to Chattanooga and Indiana to visit friends about a year later. It saw me through two cross country moves, and came only about a hundred miles away from seeing both coasts with me.

But it also saw the bad.

When I was in an abusive relationship for 6 or 7 years, it was a safe haven. The only space I truly had to myself. During that time, it also saw the darkest moment of my life. My ex publicly humiliated me at fastfood restaurant. Then when we were confronted by the staff, because I was the one crying and visibly upset, she played it off as if I was the one abusing her. After she drove off that night, I got in my car and pointed it at a brick wall about 50 yards away. For only a second I floored the gas, just to see how it would feel. That moment horrified me, and I got help about a week later, though it still took years to accept that my ex was abusive and leave.

That car never judged me, and it never failed to be there when needed it.

When I finally got out of that relationship, and met my first boyfriend, that car carried us all the way to Washington DC for the first Women’s March. Later that year it carried us around Yellowstone, through Montana, and to Seattle in one the wildest and most amazing adventures of my life. I’ve lived in Seattle for around 3 years now, and I even bought a condo just a few months ago.

That car got me, and I got it. It was forgiving of the things I was bad at (like when I got a little container to be a trash can that sat right behind the passenger seat, but always let it overflow before taking it out). But I also didn't care when the interior handles for the back-seat doors started to come off if you pulled them too hard, and I made sure everything important was taken care of. When the driver side door started to creak, I gave it WD40, when the radio broke down, I just got a Bluetooth speaker to use with my phone, when the a rear door window wouldn’t stay up, because I couldn’t afford to replace the motor for it, I had the shop take the motor out and put in a makeshift part that just always held it closed.

I used to talk to it sometimes. Just little conversations every now and then. Whenever it broke down, I'd pat its dashboard and reassure it that it was okay, it would get fixed. And when I made the move to Seattle, I told it I knew it was getting old, that this wasn't going to be easy, but that I believed in it.

It took care of me, and I took care of it. 

At the accident last night. I was the first to get out my car, and check on the two other drivers. After that I looked back and saw how busted up it was. In so many ways, I’m at the best place in my life, and I finally feel truly safe for the first time. Staring at that car as it sat there in the rain with its hood totally caved in and radiator crushed, I realized it would never drive again. But this time instead of me talking to it, letting it know it would be okay, it stared back at me as if to say ""it's okay, you don't need me anymore. It's time to let me go""

I’m grateful I’m alive and no one was hurt in the accident. I’m also grateful that car carried me as far as it could. After the accident, everyone in my life has been supportive, but most don’t really get what that car actually meant me. I knew that car longer than the dog I grew up with, and almost as long as I knew my mother. Next year, I would have known it half my life. Its awkward, but while everyone around me is understandably focused on making sure I am okay, I feel like I’m mourning one of the oldest and best friends of my life. I know I will move forward, and it’s even fitting that that car came into my life when I needed it most and held on just long enough for me to get where I needed to be. But I will miss that car for the rest of my life.",1.0,-225.0,-247.0,0.0,-195.0

I messaged the support team, I wish I could screencap it but since it's a banking app Android blocks screencaps. The message was as follows.

-[Initial Message]-
Topic: More Money in my account than I thought I had

I went to bed last night and swear I only had $2, but looking at my account today it said I have $22. I know it changed and I don't see any deposits that would have added the extra $20. I'd hate to spend money that doesn't belong to me even if it's tempting to get gas with so I just want to know if this is a mistake or if a payment was declined or a deposit took a while to process or something.
I really can't find anything myself that would make this add up and as I said I rather not spend money that isn't rightfully mine. If this was a mistake, please remove the surprise money since it's not mine. If it's not, at least tell me so I can calm down. I'd like an explanation if one can be provided but it's okay if I don't get one, confirmation is good enough.

So I left the house for a bit and on the drive back I got a message myself, and reading it made me smile. I'm gonna have to redact a few things but here it is.

Awhhh, you are so kind and thoughtful that this message genuinely made me smile. 

So when I take a look it appears that the Steamgames.co ### transaction for $19.99 that was initiated February 6, 2020 was cancelled. 

Sometimes, merchants just take a while to finalize on transactions and the hold for the funds can fall off making it look like the funds have credited back into the account, but the merchant can reclaim those funds at a later date. I can't tell if this transaction is from the transaction being cancelled or the merchant taking time to finalize.

If you want to be certain you can reach out to the merchant to see if it was cancelled. If not, it's safe to assume they'll pull it at a later date. 

All the best,

Granted, we're only a small school in a small town, and are a bit more close knit, but we have never had this level of organization in any event in our school. We've never until that point had a moment where every single student got together for one purpose. And it was a beautiful to see that sea of pink in the hallways.

427,90,90happy,happy,"I still totally think this was a great revenge so I wanted to put this story somewhere! I’m excited and uplifted to have found this subreddit.







Alt/Throwaway account because it involves child abuse and I don’t want to get anyone in trouble for how they handled things.







I guess this is more my mom’s story than mine, but I was involved. It’s about how I got my sister. I’ll call myself Sara and my friend Alex.







Since middle school, I have been best friends with Alex. It all started with us being paired for a project, and we did great together! I struggled often in school, so my parents were so happy. So I invited her to eat lunch with my group of misfit friends. She was an outcast, too. From then on, she would help me with any schoolwork I needed, and I would help her with math. See, I wasn’t born in America, and my family immigrated during a critical period in my language development, so I needed anything and everything I wrote for classes proofread and edited. Don’t get me wrong, I’m pleased we moved for my mom’s career- she became basically Dr. Cuddy to our small town hospital and clinic- but that sort of move isn’t all roses.







Alex was great at improving my written work. Even my parents loved her, because they saw my grades go up as she helped me, and she was always respectful and quiet. A Good Influence.







We quickly became best friends, so much so that everyone at school tended to refer to us in one breath as “AlexandSara.” The only classes we ever had differently were AP English for her, regular for me, and our language classes. She took one and I took the other.







I still feel bad about not figuring out what was going on earlier. But Alex was the brainy one, not necessarily me. Sure, there were hints. I’m pretty sure it’s not normal for your friend to eat half your kitchen when she comes over, or my having to sneak her breakfast and other extras. But I just thought it was a weight thing. Alex’s mom was a rail thin athlete, who also thought it was important for her kids to be bilingual. It’s hard to know what’s going on when you don’t even know a dozen words of said difficult foreign language. And we hardly ever went to Alex’s house anyway.







Over a period of the first three years I knew her, Alex slowly changed. It was nearly unnoticeable unless you knew her as well as I did, but she went from talkative and happy to withdrawn and...crushed. I don’t know how else to describe it. It was like cutting off oxygen to a fire. Her flame suffocated. She didn’t want to go swimming or play sports any more, wore jeans and long sleeves no matter the weather, and seemed perpetually exhausted. Toward the end, I swear she was losing weight, and was as white as notebook paper. Another funny thing was that she *never* cried.






I, I mean we, *tried*. But every time, Alex would insist everything was fine, no matter who or how asked her. Eventually I dropped the subject. I could tell she was getting annoyed with me.






One late winter day, it was weirdly warm. It’s cold where we lived then, so of course we went for a walk. The sunset bathed everything in red. We were out so long that it was nearly dark when we stumbled back.






Alex tripped or something. Partially melted ice is the worst, and it was right at the foot of the neighbors’ gravel driveway. Before I got there, she was already staggering to her feet again, so it can’t have been that bad.






“I just cleaned, so take off your shoes at- Alex, you’re bleeding,” my mom called, abruptly switching tack mid sentence, as we dragged mud inside.






“I’m okay. I just fell down in some gravel.” But one knee looked ruined, and there was a big scrape just above her elbow, already bleeding through the shirt.






“Let me-” mom insisted.






“*No!* I mean, no thank you.”






I caught a note of panic in Alex’s voice. Alex never panicked. Why now, over something so minor?






“Don’t be stupid. You might have some pieces of gravel embedded where you fell.” Alex flinched at the use of “stupid,” but she was four foot eleven and a hundred pounds if that at the time. No contest. My family’s unusually tall. It wasn’t hard for my mom and I to steer her, limping badly, into the kitchen.






I knew the routine from my mom treating a million childhood bumps and bruises, and went to get the massive first aid kit from the bathroom.







“Alex, hold still so I can-“ Then thirty seconds of the loudest silence I ever heard, just broken by the tap running, greeted me as I came back in.







“Sara, put it on the table. Alex, *breathe*. You’re panicking,” my mom finally said. Then I saw what made my friend finally lose her cool.







The parts of her arm not scraped raw were covered in a web of scars, some old, some fresh.






“Why didn’t you tell me?” I blurted out.







My mom told me sharply in our language to be quiet if I couldn’t help, told Alex it was okay, she wasn’t mad, we’ll discuss this after we finish patching you up. There were more scars on Alex’s legs, too.






Eventually, with lots of stopping and starting because she was crying so hard, we found out that Alex had been hurting herself for almost three years. She was always anxious. Everything had to be perfect for her mom. Even admitted, in a roundabout way, that said mom told her really cruel things, called her names, and didn’t like to give her enough to eat. Think Amy Chua with a food complex.







And of course, my mom had to tell her, hey, I’m going to tell whichever of your parents comes to pick you up tomorrow about this. So you can get help. “Better you than me. They’ll kill- I mean, be so angry then,” Alex, looking resigned, said.







I woke up to a raging argument the next morning. Couldn’t be my dad or brother- dad was abroad, brother already in college. No, this was a catfight. I went over to where Alex was sleeping and covered her ears. This was nasty. I told her she really didn’t want to hear it. But I didn’t have four hands, so I heard it all. I recognized her mom’s voice. No, I won’t get her any help, she’s lying. Just being dramatic. Don’t listen to her. Don’t tell me how to parent.







Finally, my mom asked point-blank whether Alex’s mom would be pursuing any kind of treatment for her kid. Mommy Dearest said no, I get to choose medical care for my own kid, she’s only sixteen.






What happened next would have knocked me over if I hadn’t already been sitting down. I strained my ears and just caught, “...you’re right. It is your choice. But, I’m a mandated reporter due to my job, and you’ve just admitted you’re going to neglect your child’s serious medical problem. I put a tape recorder somewhere for this talk in case things got ugly. It would be a shame if someone reported you to CPS with evidence, you being a teacher and community figure…”







I jumped about eight feet in the air when Alex’s mom yelled back, “Are you *threatening* me?”







“Not at all, Mrs. X,” my mom said calmly. “What I’m saying is that if *you* don’t help Alex, *I* will. My family has grown to love her and we don’t want anything to happen. I have a form here that would allow me to make medical decisions for her, just temporarily. Sign it, leave her with us, and I won’t report you to CPS.”







There was more arguing, but my mom had clearly shifted the balance of power her way. I don’t know exactly how she did it, but she got the signature, and we kept Alex. I was so happy to finally, really get a sister, whatever the circumstances. And my dad? He had been abroad for a few weeks at that time. I can’t imagine *that* conversation! Like, “I saw a stray human, can we keep her?”







And Alex got better. I mean, at first there were a lot of arguments. It was like pulling the pin on a grenade. Once she couldn’t cut, Alex had no idea how to handle herself! I mean, she barely slept! I was sure she was going to get the boot- if I’d said those things-, but my mom is my hero, and the calmest person I know. Then I had a huge shock- my perpetually strong friend cried for weeks on end. Well, at least it wasn’t cursing or yelling.






After things were a little calmer (which took a few months), my parents, Alex’s parents, a mediator, and Alex’s stockbroker uncle all sat down together. See, Alex’s uncle had an education fund he was tending for her, and he was appalled to learn of his sister in law’s conduct.






By then, she was seventeen. It wasn’t too hard to pull the funds a year early and use them to pay for Alex’s portion of the family insurance premium, since they were furious about continuing to pay it. In return, her parents signed a temporary guardianship form. This extended my mom’s authority past medical decisions- it’s essentially the same form that lets host families of exchange students act as parents- into all major aspects, and let her sign forms as Alex’s guardian, so she could go on field trips again. There was even enough money, if she was careful, to put Alex through all of college and provide her with a small personal allowance until she graduated. Not that my parents couldn’t afford another person, but Alex was big on not being a burden.






My parents and I moved when I was 22, and even though it’s far away, Alex knows she can visit whenever she wants. Seeing her smiling and playing with my one year old son is really what made me think to write this story here. It’s not a perfect mean or funny revenge like many I see here. 





But my revenge is having my “sister” here. Alive. She still has some problems, and can’t work full time at the moment, but has a supportive spouse, a decent part time job, and volunteers at an animal rescue.

When dad would get home, he would go right to helping her and I was left all alone. I had no siblings, I'm adopted and I never really felt like I was apart of the family. 

Fast forward to about grade 4. Mom got surgery, they removed a giant tumor from her stomach. She vowed to never let her life get so bad again and told me herself, that she was never going to take shit from anyone else ever again. I was so excited for her, she finally did it and was ready to take on the world. I though I finally had my mother back. I was so happy. But then she started going to school. She left me behind and began studying every weekend. I wouldn't see her for weeks or months at a time, she would come home late and would leave before I even woke up. 

Dad was always doing work related things so I wouldn't see him at all until around 19:00 when he would come home, take off his belt and sit on the couch until 22:00 at which point he would go upstairs and pass out on his bed. I wouldn't see him until the next day, when he did the same thing. It was rough for him, having to pay off all the debts from medical care, on top of not having his wife at home to say hello to him. It was tough. 

At this point, my mental health got worse. They had to pull me out of a school I really enjoyed and had all my friends. I was miserable, being at a school with people I didn't know. Constantly being bullied day in and day out. It was terrible, especially feeling not with the boys because I was trans, but not being liked by the girls since I had a boys body. Life was awful. I went to a psychiatrist with my dad. He told me that I was suffering from many things, and that the fact that I wasn't taking medication for it was ridiculous. He put me on a bunch of medications. Now it was even harder to pay these things off.

At this point, I was dying emotionally, hoping that anyone would just help me be happy. Constantly looking at pictures from around the house of when I wasn't miserable and hoping that I would die. 

Skipping forward years, I was in grade 8. Still struggling with mental health. Still wanting to die. At this point I had already been admitted into a mental institution twice, still getting bullied, mom was still gone, dad was still working. I graduated middle school. Never had a single break, was constantly taking classes throughout summer. Went into college at 16.

I dropped a semester due to constant panic attacks, major depression episodes, and constant hallucinations. Admitted myself into an outpatient group therapy program. I hated it at first. I thought I was never going to fit in with these people. Then someone came up to me and introduced me to everyone. 

I was in that program for 3 months. Not much considering I was in therapy since I was 7. But it helped me once I finally gave in and asked for help.

I graduated last Monday. Though I'm still struggling to work out my emotions. I made friends who are there for me and can talk about my past trauma of sexual assault and just simply dealing with my emotions. I'm not entirely happy yet, but I can say for a fact that I'm getting there. And now I have friends who can help guide my path. I feel refreshed and finally, I don't want to die.",1.0,-327.0,-81.0,-300.0,-285.0
431,94,94happy,happy,"My daughters came to live with us in late November 2004 from a crappy foster care situation and living in a van with their drug addled prostitute biological mom before that. Things were still very new to them. They were still adjusting to their new home and were amazed at the simple things like eating, playing with toys that belonged to them and having nice clothes to wear.

When the Christmas tree went up, they didn't have any idea what it was. They thought it was pretty and enjoyed decorating it and looking at it but other that... no clue.

When we talked about Santa they were clueless about that as well. They couldn't believe such a thing was possible. They were four and five years old at this point and had never experienced a Christmas of any consequence.

We took them to the nice mall for a visit to Santa. They asked, ""dad... that man really brings us presents?"" Of course, I explained and told them the whole deal.

I was really bothered by the fact that they came from a  foster home and never got a single present, a tree or any of the traditions associated with it. When we picked up the girls from the foster home, the foster mom didn't give us anything except a bag of mens tube socks...no toys, dolls, nothing.

Gradually stacks of presents gathered under the tree, and on Christmas eve we put out milk and cookies for Santa.

They were very skeptical about the whole deal and were questioning the whole down the chimney thing and trying to find holes in my story.

We were listening to Christmas music and reading stories and they kept running to the front window.

I thought they were looking for Santa. Finally, I said, ""Santa won't come till later after you are asleep.""

The girls said, ""no dad we are looking for the police mans they always come get us at Christmas""

Sad.

Anyway, when the girls went to sleep I put on my big work boots stomped them around in the fireplace and left dirty boot prints on the white carpet leading to the cookies, took a bite, drank some milk, put out the Santa presents and went to sleep.

The next morning about 8AM I heard a tremendous squealing and laughing.

They dragged me downstairs to show me the footprints and the half eaten cookie. He's real! he's real!!!

I went into a dollar store one day after work just to buy junk food. I love doing that cause you usually get way more there than you would elsewhere.

At any rate, the candy section is near the cash desk and as I'm picking out my several poisons, I hear a customer being a d-bag to the cashier. I hate it when people do that. Been in customer service for years and I know how it is. You are basically defenseless for the most part when someone decided to mistreat you.

I finish picking out my junk including a strange item, a coconut key lime, two piece chocolate.

I get up to the counter and smile at the cashier. She didn't look happy. I changed that in the following manner.

Me: Hey when did you get these? (hold up the key lime coconut thingy)

Cashier: Very recently I haven't tried them. I'd like to though.

(She lightens up a bit.)

Me: Could you please leave them out of the bag? I'd like to try them right away. Thank you. (purposely being extra pleasant and polite)

She does as I asked and finishes ringing up my junk. I pay and then I do what she obviously didn't expect.

I pick up the key lime coconut thingy, open it up and offer the first piece to her. I take the second piece and we both bite in at the same time.

Me: Pretty good eh!

Cashier: (smiling) Yeah! I gotta get some before I leave work today.

Me: I sure would! You have a great day eh? (Yeah I'm Canadian)

Years ago I had a flea market booth. I sold a bit of everything, new and used. I only stopped cause the property was sold to put condos on it. I miss that place. Anyway...

One day I was there doing my thing, hanging out in the sun and chatting with random awesome people and selling stuff to some of them when this little kid comes up and goes for the toys.

I had a ton of Hot Wheels there for $1 each or buy 5 get 1 free... but I digress.

I see no sign of parents so I ask him ""Where's mom?"" and he tells me as he points in a vague direction, ""Over there."" and he continues looking at the cars. 

Now this kid couldn't have been more than 5 or 6 years old and he was alone at a big market. I'm scared for this kid and, honestly, pissed off at his mom for not taking better care of him. 

I'm about to call one of the flea market staff over when a girl shows up and gets the kid. She couldn't have been more than 11 or 12 so not much better. 

I figure that's that, big sis came and got him and I go back to doing my thing. 

Not ten minutes later the kid is back and straight over to the cars. I start talking to him asking which car he likes best cause I figure at this point he is safer with me than he is wandering around the place. I know I'm going to keep him safe cause, well, I know me. 

So I tell him, ""Hey, take any car you like. Pick one."" He looks up at me with the biggest smile and widest eyes.

""Really?"" he can't believe it!

""Yep!"" I tell him and we continue to talk about the best car to play with. He finally picks one and his mom shows up with big sis. 

He runs up to her all excited with his free car. She barely acknowledges him, doesn't even look in my direction. Piece of work...grrrrrrrr!

Big sis runs over and says thanks and the little guy smiles and waves as they vanish never to be seen by me again. 

By now that kid is likely in his teens...if I have my timeline right. I hope his life is better than I saw that day. I hope my small action sits with him and he pays it forward.

All last month I looked through all of my stuff to see if I could find anything that I would want to get rid of and I found my husband’s childhood N64 with our games, including my Gold/Holographic Majora’s Mask that my mom’s ex-fiance gave to me and my little brother before leaving our lives.

I already have the Collector’s Edition and my husband has the 3DS version so I was going to try to sell it… But I couldn’t. I loved that man almost as much as I love my own dad. I couldn’t sell it for extra AMKE money.

My little brother also has the Collector’s Edition, but he was having financial problems. I figured that I could give it to him and he could do whatever he wanted with it. I included the game in his Christmas presents and we had this conversation:

Him: “Oh sweet! I already have this game but it’s really cool to have the Gold Cart/Holographic edition!”  


Me: “I know. I’m giving it to you in case you need extra money. I couldn’t bring myself to sell it. It means a lot to me but I’ll be happier if you can get some use from it.” (Husband’s N64 doesn’t have the expansion pak. Also I was trying to get rid of things anyway.)

Him: “Wait, was it (husband’s)?”

Me: “No… It was the one given to us by (mom’s ex-fiance.)”

Him: “Wait what really?! Well I can’t sell it *now*! I’m going to have this thing on display!”

For the record, my mom only broke up with her ex-fiance because she decided that he deserves to raise his own child. One that she wasn’t willing to give him because she’s already a mother of two. Not for anything bad.

And a couple years ago I was able to find him after almost twenty years later. Funnily enough, I was able to spot him because of the Zelda shirt he was wearing, and my eyes have a special ability to lock onto Zelda anything. (He’s the one who got me into the series.) He was at the movie theater with his own flesh and blood son who was about five or six. He’s getting his son into Ocarina Of Time the same way he got me and my brother into it. I told him about how my brother, my mom and I are doing, introduced him to my husband (then fiance) and he then said something like

“I would wonder about how you guys are doing sometimes. Now I don’t have to.”

Okay, so I was worn out earlier at work.

 There was a kid (about 10?) that came up to the front desk to see about renewing and replacing her library card. She usually goes there with her grandfather (You have to have a parent/guardian with you to get a card if you're under 18), but unfortunately, he passed away. We asked if she had anyone with her, and she said she was with her grandmother, but she had a leg problem, so she couldn't come to the front desk. (The entrance leads you to the children's room, and there's a ramp you have to take to go to the front circulation desk along with the main library) I offered to go down stairs and renew the card (You typically HAVE to do it upstairs, but the supervisor made an exception), so that her grandmother wouldn't have to struggle with going upstairs. So I get her card renewed, and the grandmother asked to see her husband's account if we hadn't cancelled it. There was a 5$ fine on there. She was about to pay it, but I was like ""You know what? Keep the 5, I'll forgive the fines. They were late books, and we have them, so what's the harm?""  

Keep in mind, we have to keep you on file with a card that you fill out. It's upstairs, so as I'm going to renew the cards, I had to run up and downstairs two or three times. But I'd rather be tired for a few minutes than have these people have a rough day.

In that, I mentioned that my husband had something similar planned this year (2019), so, little late, but here we go.



So two years after the Nintendo Switch released into the world and became like, one of the most popular handheld gaming systems of the century next to the Gameboy, Nintendo came out with an updated version. Spec-wise, the thing was perfectly identical, except for one thing that virtually everyone had been clamoring for; a longer battery life.

Our local game shop ran this campaign (likely with approval of the big guys themselves) to take in people's old Switches and exchange them with the new versions for an upcharge fee of 70 euros. The condition for this, though, was that the Switch couldn't be damaged in any way. My Switch was fine to be traded in, but my husband's had this one (barely noticeable) scratch across the screen. It wasn't bad, really, but if you paid attention, you'd notice it.

Still, he needed a Switch for work, AND he often traveled long distances for work, so it'd be beneficial for him to get the upgrade. So, he shelled out the extra 300 euros to get himself a brand new Switch. Which left the question; what to do with the old one?

See where this is going?

Initially, the plan was to sell the old Switch to someone (maybe my mom), but when Christmas was closing in, suddenly my husband had the brilliant idea to give it to my sister for Christmas.

I was fine with that. I mean, it was his system, still, so he could do what he wanted with it. Hell, I even threw in my copy of Mario Party (didn't play it as often after the first few weeks), so she'd at least have one game to play on it. However, I was still a bit unsure about whether there'd even be games on it for her that she'd like.

That is, until all three of us headed out to our game shop and got to discussing games. Where we (subtly) brought up the subject of her potentially getting a Switch.

Sis: I dunno... I mean, I got BotW for Wii U, and I wasn't able to finish that game cuz it was too hard...

Now remember; she's not a hardcore gamer anymore, so it makes sense that she would be overwhelmed by BotW, and we told her as much.

H: If BotW is too hard for you, maybe you should try Link's Awakening.

Sis: Hmhmm... Oh! I like the look of this game! \*picks up Splatoon 2\*

Me: Oh... that's mostly a multiplayer game, though...

Sis: Oh... never mind then. \*puts the case back\*

After a bit more back and forth and scouring the shelves, we asked her that, if she could pick any Pokemon game to get for Switch, which would she take. Took her a bit, but she eventually decided on Sword. Which might be an idea for her for when the new DLC drops...

Anyway, after ensuring she won't buy the Switch with her own money, we head home, now more than happy with the decision to give it to her later.

Come Christmas time, and a few presents left and right, it's finally time\~

She worked on the package slowly, slipping a finger under the paper to undo the tape, and began tearing off a section to the side... revealing a bright right box with a joy-con plastered on top of it, giving her pause.

Sis: \*visibly gobsmacked as she pulled the Switch case out\* You're kidding...!

Me & H: Nope!

Me: No, we're not kidding!

H: Open the box and see what's inside. There's something else there.

That worried her, of course, as she slowly opened it, almost afraid that there wasn't anything in there at all. Even after she lifted up the top and saw that, yes, the Switch was *definitely* in there, she wasn't sure, yet.

Sis: I'm afraid...

H: It's under the Switch.

Sis: I know, but I'm still afraid... \*lifts up the Switch\* MARIO PARTY!! :D \*grinning from ear to ear\* That's cool! Thank you!

I ended up being late and missing my flight, unfortunately and had to wait another day before I had to leave. The next day, I took my first plane and landed on Miami because I was taking a connected flight back to Pennsylvania but apparently they hadn't secured a seat for me so I can head back home and I was a little nervous but thought ""It's no problem, they'll get me a seat in no time."" I was wrong. Plane after Plane with no luck. After my 4th plane I started to cry because I was scared I wasn't going to make it back. I cried and cried for a few minutes before this nice, light skinned lady came up to me. She was skinny and I think she had a buzz cut, if I remember correctly.   
When she came up to me she said ""I'm not going to ask if you're okay because you're clearly not okay, what's wrong?"" Or something along those lines and through tears and a little bit of snot I explained the whole situation to her and my fear of getting stuck since I had no one. She stood with me while my flight attendant was trying to get me a seat and calmed me down a little and my Flight attendant came back, I think we had no luck after that one and I was once again back in the waiting room.

447,111,111happy,happy,"Old story, but since my husband is pulling a similar stunt this year as I did last year,

Background; I’m a gamer at heart, and have been since the very first Pokémon game released. I got Pokémon Red and my younger sister got Pokémon Blue. We didn’t get a link cable initially, as we had to share my dad’s Gameboy to play, but we were happy with them nonetheless. We continued playing Pokémon as we grew older, but my sister drifted away from gaming around Gen 3 and began to focus on other things.

Now, I didn’t play Pokémon exclusively. When I was at home, I would sit down in the living room, hook up our Playstation (the original) and play Chrono Cross. My sister would sometimes sit down and watch me play the game, sometimes for hours on end, commenting on everything I did in game and sometimes roleplaying as the characters with me when I did something dumb or silly.

Before continuing, quick note; the original Playstation was region-locked (yeah, I know, dumb), but could be modded to play games from other region and… wait for it… pirated games. This was during a time when it was still hip and cool. Rest assured, I’ve grown over that.

When I moved out of my parents’ house with my then-boyfriend-now-husband, I left most of the games that we had at my parents’ house for my sister to enjoy… but I forgot to leave behind a memory card. Whoops.

Anyway, my sister didn’t play on it much, because it was too much of a hassle for her to set it up. When she finally moved out, though, she had the space to set it up and began playing games on it on occasion (mostly Crash Bandicoot 2 and 3).

Now the main story;

Last year, somewhere mid-May, I believe, we were all at my parents’ house for dinner, when she asked me a question.

Sis: Hey, do you still have Chrono Cross?

Me: Yeah, I do. …Why?

Now, Chrono Cross was one of the few games I had opted to take with me for two reasons.

1) it was still one of my favorite games of all time for the PS1

2) I had actually bought it officially after the pirated version we had got scratched to the point where it was no longer playable.

Sis: Well, can I borrow it?

Me: Wait… you wanna play it?

Sis: Yeah.

Me: Why? I mean, you can borrow it, sure, but why so suddenly?

Sis: Well, I took the Playstation to my apartment and as I was playing I thought ‘Hey, I’ve never actually *played* Chrono Cross. I’ve only ever watched you play it.

Me: Oh yeah, you did.

Sis: Oh! And can I also borrow your memory card? I think you took it with you.

Me: Did I not leave any? Ah, my bad. Yeah, I’ll look for them so you can borrow them.

However, when I got home afterward, I had a MUCH better idea.

I went online, and found (and bought) her an actual copy of Chrono Cross plus a memory card, to gift her for Christmas. And not just a second-hand copy; no, I got her a *brand new* copy of it. So new, that the Squaresoft logo was replaced with that of Square Enix.

She did ask every so often if I’d found the game and card yet, and I would say I hadn’t, but I’d try to find it ASAP. 

Finally, Christmas arrived, and we’re at my parents’ house. I, as usual, am handing out the presents to everyone. After a few presents between the rest of my family and husband, I gave my sister her present. Now I’d wrapped them both up in one package, with the memory card obscuring the cover of the game, so you’d see that first and would have to pull it away to see the rest.

As she pulled away the wrapping, you could see the confusion on her face as she read out loud, before shifting to realization.

 Sis: Playstation… ooooh! Memory cards! Awesome!

And then she removed it from the game case.

The second she realized what she was looking at, she gasped and – no joke – she squealed, and I laughed as she excitedly showed it off to everyone.

Me: Now you don’t have to borrow it; now you have your own copy.

I've got a tradition in which I go to the local supermarket on Monday every 2 weeks to buy myself a few bottles of soft drink (that's Soda for you American people), as well as some snacks. Living with my grandmother and uncle is hard for someone like me since I eat and drink a lot.Anyway, this particular day, I saw this homeless guy begging out the front of the supermarket asking for spare change. I know the general rule of thumb not to give a homeless person money, just in case he uses it to buy himself drugs or alcohol, and I don't carry any money with me anyway because I find it easier using my debit card. I went ahead with my business, buying myself the stuff I need/want to last me the fortnight until my next trip to the shops. Since it is almost Summer, and the recent Spring days have been really darn hot, I decided I'd buy the homeless guy a bottle of water. I grabbed a 1.75 litre bottle of spring water and bought it alongside the rest of my things.I went to the place where I saw the homeless guy and noticed the stool he was sitting on was vacant. The dude was nowhere to be seen, but then I didn't get a good look at him on my way in anyway. I looked around briefly to see if I could find him (I couldn't) and decided I'd leave the water on the stool, he'll probably take it when he gets back.Soon as I put the bottle of water on his stool, I heard him call out to me from a few metres away. He gave me a wave and said ""thanks buddy"". I'm usually a quiet person so I smiled, gave him a thumbs up, and walked away.

Our mom was addicted to drugs and our Dad M.I.A until I was like 7 but then died of an overdose before I turned 8. We were sent to live with our grandparents who were major dicks and would constantly put me down and get mad at ME when my brother stood up for me. He was honestly like a real G. But then when I was 15 he died, someone hit him with a car. It was an accident and I try not to hold it against them because ik it was an accident (still hard though). Anyways all that to say I've never really had family besides my brother, none that felt like it anyhow. Well after he died I moved in with my Great Aunt in a different state and was welcomed into the family with open arms. My brother and I would visit in the summer and they were some of my happiest memories but we were too far to have a real family connection if that makes sense (I mean it was real but it's not the same ig). In moving here I've felt so much love my family that I literally cry sometimes out of happiness. For 15 years I've only cried out of sadness and in these last two years I've cried of joy so many times I cant even keep count. I have so many cousins here of all varying ages, and they're so amazing. Literally just their desire to hangout with me means the literal world to me and everytime they do things that show me they love me I just wanna cry.  For the first time in my life I feel like I have parents that care about me, I finally get to experience what it's like to have a real mother, and it's such an amazing thing to have. My uncle talks to me like a daughter and dead ass I can honestly say that all my weird mommy/daddy issues are gone. Ik that's weird but I used to joke about it and now I feel like I CANT. One of my cousins has become like my older sister and we hangout almost every weekend. Shes helped me build my confidence up so much and realize that I DESERVE respect, and I deserve more than what I had. She recently changed my contact name to sister and I didnt say anything but I cant express how happy that made me.  My other cousin always wants to hangout with me and she had a childhood similar to mine so I get to have that connection and understanding that I had with my brother over shared traumas (again weird thing to say but it's nice to have someone who truly understands). Theres so many more people that have become my family that I could write a whole book. I literally love them all with all my heart, and although nothing can replace the relationship I had with my brother, they have helped me heal from losing him and have brought joy in my life that I didn't know  was possible to feel. As someone who spent the first 15 and a half years crying myself to sleep and contemplating suicide on a weekly/daily basis, to feel this level of love and joy at 17 seems surreal. I'm happy. I cant express to them the pure love I have for them because I dont know how to without seeming weird. And they all grew up with eachother, with that family connection, it might be weird because I didnt so everything I feel is so new and strong. Plus due to past stuff I have a hard time expressing my emotions to people but I just really needed an outlet to share how much I love them. They are such beautiful people, they are what brought joy back into my world and I can never thank them enough for it. I went from having a train wreck of a life to an almost perfect one, the only thing that would make it better is if my brother were here and got to experience it too, but I know hes happy knowing I'm not alone, knowing that I'm finally happy.",1.0,-108.0,-80.0,-250.0,-120.0

This starts off a bit sad, but it gets better I swear. So just bear with me through the sad bit.


Back in college I was in a very bad place. Eventually it came to a head in February, becoming too much to bear, and I attempted suicide. After going to the hospital and returning back to my residence room for weeks I felt worse and worse.I described it as an emotional hangover, like as if I thought it would just pass. Before hand I had struggled with self harm. But after it just got worse. At one point my arms were covered in injuries. Naturally when I went out I wore long sleeves. So when I went to my practical lab (it was like a functional spa, I was in an esthetician course) I wore a cardigan over my uniform. I was booked to do a pedicure that day. That meant rolling up my sleeves. Obviously I had an issue with that. I mustered up the courage to ask my teacher if she had gauze and medical tape. I said I had some injuries that I wanted to protect when doing the pedicure service. She said she did and insisted on bandaging them for me. I let her. When she saw the damage her face dropped. I broke and told her what I had been got through. She continued to bandage me and tell me how getting to know me through the semester had been a pleasure, she had grown to like me, thought I was important, needed, talented, and special. She said so many nice and encouraging things to me in that small storage room. At that point I had been so alone, felt so worthless and invisible. For the first time in awhile I felt noticed and understood. I cried for the first time in front of another person in a very long time. It was such a vulnerable moment it touched me deeply. I had never felt so deeply moved. Someone cared. It meant more than anything in the world to me. She finished bandaging my arms, and sent me out to do the pedicure. When I was done, she sent me to the counseling department in the college. We had a second teacher in this class, and she was the one to walk me up there. She was a lot like the other teacher where she showed me a lot of compassion as well, she offered to listen if ever needed. She told me I could even come before class to do so. Thanks to that day that classroom became a place I felt a little safer and a little more comfortable. It was nice. I didn't have anything like that at that time. Thanks to them, the words they said, and their actions I'm still fighting. The compassion they showed me sort of opened my eyes. I can and do matter. I'm still struggling, but I'd say I'm doing much better than I was. I hope I can get in contact with them again so I can thank them. I'll be forever grateful.",1.0,-239.0,-112.0,-650.0,-30.0

Donner gathered the rest of Santa’s  sleigh team for another meeting behind the workshop,

Except for Rudolph, he was off getting his hooves done. The pretty boy that he is. 

“Gather ‘round boys, gather ‘round”, Donner said, “Is everyone here?”

“Yeah!!!”, Blitzen shouted. 

“Don’t you start!!”, Donner said. 

Blitzen hung his head and pouted out his lip

Donner continued, “Now, I must admit, last year, was really...REALLY fun, am I right?”

Blitzen smiled, looked from side to side, raised his head slightly, and said, “Yeah”, then lowered his head quickly

“Who said that? Was that you, Blitzen?”, Donner asked. 

There was no response

Donner continued, “Although, last year WAS fun, Santa was really, really mad, I mean, he wouldn’t even let us frolic with the foes for two whole weeks. 

So, this year, we’re going to have a nice, normal Christmas Eve run, no shenanigans, everyone got it!!!”

“Yeah”, Blitzen said loudly

“That’s it!!!, I knew THAT was you, no fruit cake for you, young man”, Donner said. 

Blitzen snorted at him

”Okay!!” Donner said, ”Hooves in, everyone, on three.”

“1...2...3”, he said. 

“REINDEER’S RULE!!!”, they all. shouted, then went about their daily routine. 

As the days passed, it was business as usual. 

Although, Santa did keep a close eye on the elves, who would sometimes slip the reindeer’s extra food.

He DID NOT want a replay of last year. 

Anyway, Christmas Eve came, Santa gathered the team and harnessed them to the sleigh. 

Rudolph was last to arrive, as usual. 
He was too busy getting his tail fluffed. 

“Everything okay, Donner”, Santa said, questionably 

“Yes, Santa. Everything is A-Okay” Donner replied. 

“Good, Now, lets get to it”, Santa said. 

The elves loaded the sleigh with presents, Santa gave Mrs. Claus a kiss and away they went. 

Their first stop, the U. S. of A. 

Now, by this time, everyone in the whole entire world had heard about what happened last year and they did not want it to happen again. 

So, in every single house that Santa and the team stopped at. There was a huge piece of fruit cake, for the reindeer’s, as well as, milk and cookies for Santa. 

Because, as you all know, reindeer’s love fruitcake. 

Anyway, This continued on, through the next five continents, that being Asia, Africa, Antarctica, and South 
America. 

By the time, they left South America, on their way to their last stop, Europe, the reindeer’s had consumed so much fruit cake, that their eyes were bulging out of their heads.

Except for Rudolph, he doesn’t eat fruitcake, unless it’s vegetarian. There’s something wrong with that guy. 

Anyway, during the flight, the team suddenly became lax in performance, they began to slow their speed, wandering off course, and losing altitude, and then regaining it, just to lose it again.

Santa and the presents were tossed around the sleigh, like an old wooden roller coaster, almost dropping a few bags in the process. 

Santa pulled the team together, delivered the presents to Europe and made it back safely to the North Pole. 

”That was a bumpy ride there at the end, are you boys okay?, Santa asked. 

“Just a little tired Santa, that’s all”, Donner replied. 

The elves unloaded the sleigh, Santa unhitched the team, and went to the house for some hot chocolate and watch a movie. 

Rudolph took off through the field, to go find Clarice, but that’s a different story. 

Donner and the rest of the team waited for Santa to enter the house, before they collapsed right where they stood. 

Their tongues hanging out of their mouths, and their eyes rolled back in their heads. 

Mrs. Claus met Santa at the door, handed him his cocoa, and they snuggled on the couch, watching “Its A Wonderful Life”.

We interrupt our regularly scheduled program to bring you this late breaking news bulletin. 

An Incident has occurred throughout the entire continent of Europe. 

As Christmas morning arrived, parents and children alike were looking forward to a day full of peace and joy. 

But instead their waking up to find what appears to be...

“Can I say this on the air?...OK!!!

They are waking up to find what appears to be huge chunks of reindeer vomit splattered all over their cars, houses, and front yard Christmas decorations. 

The wet, gooey brown substance is reported to have little yellow, green and red pieces mixed within it. 

Some even have nuts. 

There are no reported injuries, but, experts are saying the cost of damages are in the millions. 

We’ll have more on this story as it unfolds.

Now back to our regularly scheduled program.

Santas eyes widened, his jaw dropped, as his hot chocolate from his hand and landed directly in his lap

He jumped to his feet, and screamed, “Donner”

Now, this doggo like a lot of them was very smart. He knew all the mechanic's names in the workshop, he could follow a variety of orders and even dealt with the loud noise perfectly. 

Whenever someone wanted a tool, someone who had the tool would call the dog over, hand the dog the tool, say ""Take it to Steve"" (for example), and he would take it to that person. He wouldn't let anyone else take it, he wouldn't open his mouth of you weren't meant to have it.

Now, Mick, as much as I idolise him, does not share my affinity for animals, he just doesn't like them at all, none of them. But this dog he seemed to get along perfectly with, he would let the dog rest by his legs, he would feed him quite happily and even pet him, which is something Mick never does.

469,133,133happy,happy,"So this happened a few years ago after starting my job. The morning started off as usual, get up at 5, wait for the bus, hope the next bus was on time. The road leading too work has a lot of lorries parked on either side blocking the paths.
Around the time I walk up cars are coming and going fast too and from work itself. 
I notice a small jack Russell without a leash walking back and forth thinking that it's someone's. I spend a few extra minutes watching people walk past incase they call her, she may just be a super well behaved dog that doesn't need a leash.
I make my way off thinking somebody will pick her up when I notice she's gone, just disappeared I thought she must have been picked up behind one of these lorries out of view and carried onto work. Until I see her between 2 lorries and poking her head out slightly, she dashes into the middle of the road cars coming round the corner. I dash into the road aiming to scoop her up and past the cars. I ended up missing but instead wrapping around her like a ball ready to be hit by a car praying that atleast she would be okay.
Luckily the driver stopped a few feet away and allowed me to scoop her up and carry her off. Her muzzle was greying and her eyes milky so she must have been blind poor thing, a friend saw the whole thing and helped me away as I was shaken up but the pup needed hugs and calming down more. 
I took her to a local hotel as its the closest building to my work and apologised and asked if they could keep her for the moment, her tag had her owners number on but by that time I was very late for work. I was anxious about this but said my goodbyes and gave her plenty of hugs before leaving her.

His back garden gate had been opened or blew open and she toddled off on a little adventure. The owner cried and thanked the hotel staff for looking after her he'd been worried sick all day and all night. She was an amazing pup and I hope they're still together today.",1.0,-40.0,-52.0,0.0,-45.0

She comes home looking exausted, since a whole football team had come in, and she had to carry so many platters of food that her knuckles bled. She asked me if I could cook a steak for her, and I gladly did it since I love cooking. She says she's running down to the store real quick to get some pinapple juice for a drink she likes, so I use the extra time I have to set something up.

I was 12 years old and very naive about sex. Literally I thought sexy was a curse word. 

It was picture day and my Nanna made me wear a dress. It was a very modest dress. It almost went to my ankles and the sleeves almost went to my elbows. 

I was walking to my next class when my male teacher noticed my hips moved in a sexy way and thought I would distract the boys. 

He was so bothered by it he went and told the principal. So I was taken out of class to be lectured about how I needed to stop being so sexy. I almost stared crying because I had no idea how I was being sexy. 

The principal went to my Nanna and told her about how sexy I was being in my dress and my Nanna wasn't having any of it. 

She looked at him dead in the eyes and said 
""Bluellan isn't trying to be sexy. She doesn't even know what sexy means. It's just the way she walks. But if makes YOU so uncomfortable, then I make sure she doesn't wear that dress again.""

So my little sister (M) is really white, despite being half black. The only black thing about her is her hair. 

She was in like the 3rd or 4th grade, and the teacher had them draw a self portrait. My sister coloured herself white and the teacher saw and said she had to colour herself black. 

My sister tried to explain that her skin was white but the teacher kept saying she was black so she had to colour herself black. This went on for 15 mins and at the end the teacher was screaming at my sister to colour herself black. My sister, sobbing, obeyed and coloured herself black. And I mean black. Not brown, not tan, but charcoal black. 

My sister told my nanna and my nanna was so angry. My nanna is a teacher too and you can imagine how this made her feel. But she actually had a meeting with all the teachers and principal a couple of days later. (IEP things). 

She went to the meeting and brought my other sister (A) whose a lot darker then M with her. 
After all the hellos were said, the principal asked my Nanna if she had anything she'd like to say. 

My Nanna said yes and stood up to her full 5 feet, looked directly into that teachers eyes and said "" I want you to explain to me, why you thought it was appropriate to force a crying child to colour herself black?!"" 

The teacher went pale and tried to studder excuses, but my Nanna wasn't having it. In a calm cool voice, she torn that teacher apart. She even brought A into the mix asking the teacher if she would force A to colour herself black. The teacher said no. And my Nanna asked why she made M do it when A is darker then her. 

After 30 mins, my Nanna was done. The teacher was pale and silent. The principal was red and kept apologizing. 

My Nanna sat down and calmly spend the rest of the time, talking about IEP's for my sisters.

During the infection, I decided that i wanted to quit taking my anti-depressants. (Not sure why I did this, but i did.) My infection healed after 2 weeks, but my depression and anxiety really got a grip on me, and a solid one at that. I did not go back to school. I instead spent my days on my computer, playing video games, watching YT videos, etc. I spent about a week and a half just sitting at home, not being productive, my flat became a mess. Beer cans, empty pizza boxes, and all that. At the end, my PC broke down, and it turned out it had short-ciruited, and i had to get a new motherboard. That's 350$ that i don't have.
I talked to a friend, and he said he had an older one that i could use. The catch, he said he'd bring it to school. So to avoid having to stare at a blank wall for weeks on end, I braved my depression and actually went to school the next day. I went to my classes and got notes from all the teachers about everything i had to catch up on. The strange thing was, I asked them before class began about what i missed. This was highly unusual because I am the type of guy that would rather fail a class than to ever ask the teacher about anything. The day went on, and i even stayed for an extra hour trying to catch up, and I was having fun. Yeah, fun at school. As a 19 year old man that is something that I've never had before. I was having so much fun in fact, that i forgot to meet up with my friend for the motherboard he was going to lend me. (I got it the next day) 

It's now 4 days later, and I'm feeling better than I've ever felt before. I told my friend about it today, and all he said was ""It worked then"". This was the whole reason he decided to lend me the motherboard in the first place.

478,142,142happy,happy,"Some Information before the story: 
I am a 17 year old Introvert with Social Anxiety and Selective Mutism on top of that 

Story: 
On the first school day, I was thinking about what would happen when I would enter my new class. 
As a note, I have been kind of a social outcast since 5th grade and had to always approach people on my own in order to talk to them (before you ask, I did indeed have had always at least one best friend throughout grades 5-6 and 7-10, they would however always talk to other people and rarely approach me). 
Because of this, pessimism started to set in and I thought about how I would be an social outcast again, how my classmates probably didn't want to talk to me and how everyone will be in some sort of friend group except for me. 
(At this point in my life, I have already kinda accepted the role of the lonely kid, who is always being interrupted when they're trying to talk and just listens to the stories of other people)

So, fast forward to one month later. 
I am currently talking to more than half of the class, with classmates approaching me on their own. 
Not only that, but I also have found someone, who I understand really well. 
Another plus point is that the whole class understands what Memes are.

487,151,151happy,happy,"Hey my Reddit peoples.

This story was requested by JoGyo as he wanted to know what happened to the guy who stole the magazines in my previous story “old man and his camera “ so hear we go.

Cast:

Young thug: YT

Tired Mom: TM

Old Man:

This story starts with a young man in his early teens, he was from a bad neighbourhood and like many other young lads he got into trouble, he often went shoplifting, sold stolen goods and drank and took drugs as well as getting in fights and getting arrested multiple times.

His poor tired mother was at her wits end, she was a single mother and was working three jobs trying to support her son, no matter how hard she tried to raise her son right, he would always do the opposite, “because it was more fun “.

One day YT and his friends were hanging out around a quiet area and spot the old man who owned a small restaurant opening up, then one of the friends has a great idea,”let’s wait until he closes up and rob his ass” they agree and wait knowing that the old man takes his days takings to the banks night deposit every night and that he keeps it in his money belt.

At the last minute his friends back out and tell him to do it himself as part of his initiation into the gang, YT is unfazed by this and takes an iron Barr and runs up behind the old man to deliver a massive blow to the back of his head, the old man falls forward and the YT rips the money belt from the old man’s waist and runs off, before the old man passed out he got a real good look at his attacker.

The next day TM had heard about the robbery and knew that it had to be her son, she stormed into his room and didn’t have to search for long to find the money belt, in a fit of rage she grabs YT by the ear and marches him down the street in his pyjamas and into the front door of the old mans restaurant.
The old man was there behind the counter with a bandage on his head, the doctors told him to take a few days off but he didn’t listen.
TM pulls YT up to the counter and asks the old man
 TM: is this the little shit that robbed you?

Old man: y...yes it is!

TM slams YT into the counter and says TM: he’s yours, I’m done with him, you can call the cops and have him sent to prison or you can take him out back and cut his throat for all I care, I’m done, he’s dead to me.

The old man was taken aback by this, as he knew his mother was a good woman, and for her to say this about her own son was very out of character, the old man looks at YT and decided to take pity on him and gave him a job sweeping the floors after school.

YT: fuck you old man, as soon as you’re back is turned I’ll be out the door.

Old man: yes and into an orange jumpsuit making a new friend named Buba your prison husband.

YT stopped being a little wise ass and reluctantly did as he was told.
As the days passed YT started to enjoy talking to the old man and after a week was coming to the restaurant without his mom escorting him,
He started talking to his mother about his shift at the restaurant and when he had to go to work.
His mother started to see the change in him, he stopped hanging out with his friends and spent more time with the old man at the restaurant.
After a few months YT had payed off the old man for what he stole but he kept coming back, so the old man started paying him a wage.
The money he made he gave to his mother to help pay the bills.
A year later he was waiting tables and even making the night deposits for the old man, and he even got a raise, 

the old man showed him how to cook and prepare all the dishes on the menu YT even had ideas for new menu items that he would make for his mother, after a while his mother only had to work one job and had more time for herself and reconnected with her friends.

Ten years later...

YT was walking down the street and ran into one of his old friends (OF) 

YT: hey OF how are you? What have you been up to?

OF: I just got out of jail for armed robbery, what happened to you.

YT: well you remember that restaurant...

OF: oh man, don’t tell me you’re still working there, ha what a loser.

YT just smiles at him and shakes his head and says...

YT: no... I own it!

The old man passed away and left his restaurant to YT, he works hard and made sure his mother never had to work again.
He went on to start a chain of restaurants that made him a millionaire.

The End.

Sometimes forgiveness and a second chance is all you need to change your life.

Old man: OM

Little boy: LB

Granny: herself 

One morning, the little boy was walking to the shops to buy his packed lunch for school, on his route, he passes the old tobacco shop and spots the owner of the shop standing on the opposite side of the street holding an old camera, taking a picture of his shop.
At first the little boy didn’t think much of it, but the next day at the same time he was there again with the same old camera, taking the exact same picture.

Day after day at the same time the old man took the same picture.

The little boy would watch him each day until he finally gets curious and walked up to the old man and asked,
LB: excuse me, but why are you always trying to a picture of your own shop?

The old man smiled and said OM: it’s a long story, but it’s my life’s work, hang on a second and I’ll show you.

He walks into his shop for a few minutes then walks out carrying a large photo album, he sits on the curb and opens the album to show the little boy the pictures of his shop.

OM: take a look and tell me what you see.

The little boy glances over the pictures and scratches his head, confused and perplexed.

LB:there all the same.

The old man laughed and said 

OM: look closely... the light is never the same, you see the same people pass by day after day but there clothes are different,
Then after a while you start to see new people, then the same people start to disappear and the new people become the same people and so on.

The little boy finally understands and is now amazed by each picture as he turns the pages, seeing the different cars clothes and people as the years pass by in each picture.

LB: wow...this is amazing, where did you get that old camera from?

The old man stiffens slightly as he remembered the old memories from long ago.

OM: when I was a young man fresh out of high school I started working here at the tobacco shop, one day I spot this guy about the same age as me, lurking around the magazine racks, it was obvious that he was shoplifting so I chased after him, unfortunately he got away but not without dropping his wallet, I looked through it and found that there was no money but it did have his driving license with his address.
I wasn’t in a hurry so I decided to wait till after my shift to call the police when I got home.
I look through his wallet again and this time I find a couple of photographs of him when he was a kid, in the first one he was holding a sports trophy from his school sports day, the look of joy on his face was amazing, he looked like he had won gold at the Olympic Games.
In one of the others he was with his grandmother, she had her arms wrapped around him so tightly and a face of pure love.
After looking at these pictures for what seems like hours...I just didn’t have the heart to call the police.
After a couple of months I had planned to return the wallet to him but I never got around to it.
Finally Christmas comes round and I’m determined to get the wallet back to him, I trekked out into the snow for what felt like hours, signs were covered in snow and every street looked the same, I almost gave up until by chance I found it, I walk up the steps until I reach the apartment and knock on the door...at first I hear nothing so I knocked again, louder this time and then I hear the shuffling of slippers on carpet, I then hear the voice of a very old lady.

Granny: who is it?

OM: hello I’m trying to find (name of grandson GS)

Granny: GS!...baby is that you?

Granny then undoes about seven locks and opened the door, to the old man’s surprise granny was blind, she reached out her arms to hug him.

Granny: oh baby I knew you wouldn’t forget your granny at Christmas.

Before the old man could think he just says,

OM: that’s right granny I’d never forget you.

Now granny may be blind but she was not stupid, she knew a total stranger from her own flesh and blood, and the old man knew as well, so they decided to play this game where he was her grandson and she was his granny.
They sat in the living room and talked like they knew each other for years, she would tell him about her friends and her local church, and he would tell her that he had a job working at the tobacco shop and that he met a beautiful woman and was getting married.

They talked for hours and were laughing and joking about everything, until they realised that they were getting hungry, unfortunately there wasn’t a scrap of food left in the house so the old man went out to find a shop that was open and bought a precooked chicken and some steamed vegetables and lots of other things, granny found two bottles of wine under her bed and helped set the table.
They feasted like their was no tomorrow, they sat back down in the living room and talked some more, then the old man went to the bathroom,
After washing his hands he turns to see a large stack of what were at the time brand new cameras still in there boxes, in a moment of madness he takes one and puts it in his pocket and walks back into the living room, in the time it took him to use the bathroom granny had fallen asleep.
He goes back into the kitchen and puts all the leftovers in the fridge and does all the dishes and puts them away.
Through all the racket granny slept through the whole thing, now the difficult part... he needs to leave but he doesn’t want to wake her and he can’t leave her a note, so he just puts the wallet on the coffee table and left.

Days pass and he can’t live with the guilt of what he did, New Years comes around and he decided to return to see granny and apologise, he finds the apartment and knocks on the door only to be greeted by a new family that just moved in.
Poor granny had passed away.

Months pass and on one beautiful summer day he looked at the tobacco shop that he would eventually own and remembered the camera that had remained in his jacket pocket for months and took it out and took a picture,
The next day he did it again, and again the day after and for the next forty years!

The little boy listening to every word was in awe of the story and told him 

LB: you did something so nice.

This shocked the old man 

OM: how was that nice? I lied and stole from an old blind lady!

LB: true... but you also made her last Christmas filled with laughter and she wasn’t alone, plus the camera you took you put to good use so it wasn’t in vain.

OM: I never thought of that... thanks for saying that.

The old man and little boy say their goodbyes and go about their day, giving a wave to each other each day that passes.

Years later the little boy was walking up to the tobacco shop only to see city workers clearing out the shop, the workers were taking the cigarettes and tobacco for themselves and throwing out all the other stock, including the photo albums and the camera!

The little boy asked what happened to the old man only to be told that he died, the little boy clearly very upset begged the workers for the photo albums and the camera only to be told to get lost.

A mans life’s work that meant so much to him was garbage to others.

The End 

Please let me know your thoughts on the actions of the old man, good or bad.

489,153,153happy,happy,":< this is the result of trash being thrown into the ocean. This poor duck who's name has been said to be ""Quack"" has seen this mass epidemic. He has suffered from it. Back in the wars of 1942, Quack was residing along Old Town Beach. When all of a sudden, I piece of trash was thrown onto his beak. He screamed in agony. The other ducks in the pond were shocked and very nervous about this duck's life. They quickly called an ambulance, while the mommy duck screamed and cried in despair. And when the ambulance finally arrived, the mommy duck and the daddy duck raced little Quack into the vehicle, before it sped off towards the hospital. Later at the hospital known as ""St. Juul's Quackery"" took in little quack, and rushed him to ER. They tried everything. They oxygenated him, they took off the trash, and they gave him surgery, but it was no use. The damage was done. Mommy and Daddy duck screamed as they pounded their fists against the door. ""WHY OUR SON! WHYYY!"" Before the nurses pushed them off to the waiting room, with their screaming echoing through the halls, and a flat line echoing through their son. 2 hrs later, the doctor pulled the Mommy and Daddy duck over to the side and said: ""There is a way to cure this. We must do this one surgery, and It'll cost quite a bit. Do you accept?"" The Mommy duck looked onto the doctor with tears streaming down her face, as she signed the paper and the last hope rung within her heart. 3 hrs later, the surgery was complete, and Quack was saved. The Mommy and Daddy duck ran towards their son, crying the tears of joy, Joy! And that day was marked a holiday for the duck, The Day of Quack. And 2 years later, the doctors finally found out what had caused the ailment upon little Quack. It was but an ""UNO Reverse card"". Let this be a lesson to any other people. Don't litter, or more little ducks will suffer the cause.",0.0,-124.0,-45.0,-50.0,-45.0

I had to get some slippers because I was staying at a backpacker hostel and forgot to pack mine. While I was waiting in line, I saw a mom with her kid in a stroller, the kid was maybe 2 years old and was cooing at the lollipops they by the registers. I think the kid was hungry because the mom kept mentioning that she'd give the kid some crackers she had as soon as they paid for it. 

Suddenly 2 other kids, one looking about 5 and the other about the same age as the kid. The 2 played with the kid and the kid handed over the crackers the mom gave the kid to hold. The 2 kids actually took the crackers away and their mom caught it before they left the store. I guess their mom didn't know because she paid for the crackers and left with it.

The mom with the stroller kind of chuckled and said to her kid, well I guess we'll get something else when we go for groceries. I offered to grab another packet for her and she was grateful, told me where to get it and I grabbed it.

I was well aware that I left my spot in line but I was OK with waiting in line from the end again. But when I tried to give her the crackers from the end of the line, the mom and the crowd were willing to let me come back to my original spot right behind her. She even helped to cover a dollar for me when I came up short on cash, saying that a dollar was nothing compared to the help I gave her.

But during the conversation I told her something that she ended up screenshotting and sending it to me show me. I was glad it made sense to her and soon forgot about it. 

Fast forward a few months and I fell in love with my best friend. So much that I lost myself as a person. With the nature of our relationship and how close we were, I was stupid to assume I had a chance and asked her. The rejection was unexpected and shocking and completely destroyed my confidence as a guy. Everything I had held proudly to myself was being scrutinized mercilessly by my own demons and cast aside as useless or fake. I felt naked and helpless and was reduced to a person craving external validation. 

And then, one day, as I went through my phone, I saw this photo of a conversation. And for a second I felt I could really relate to what it said and was amazed by how powerful it was for me. And then, with a shock, I realised it was my very own words. Coming from a more capable and confident version of myself lost in time, those words were soothing and powerful. 

I'll just leave it here in the comments if it makes sense to someone else going through this. :)

For context, I am a short, kind of chubby nonbinary person. I was looking for a good job interview shirt with my mom, when NL (Nice lady) walks up.


NL is probably late 60s, cart full of cat toys/baby toys, and some clothes. I was with my mom and she watched us for a little while until she came up to us by the men's dressing room. I'm in the dressing room trying to fix my binder (a thing that makes boobs look flat so you look more masculine or androgynous)

NL: is that your son in there?

Mama: kinda, (OP) is my child. They prefer gender neutral terms :)

NL: how sweet! How long have they been out?

NL and my mom keep talking while I try on more shirts, and we find out that NL has a transgender daughter and her wife just had a baby. She and my mom talk about what it's like to have queer kids and how much they both love their kids. I came out of the dressing room with a shirt I wasn't too sure about.

NL: ""How handsome!! I really like that color. Do you like it?""

I tell her I do like the color but not the sleeves. She and my mom have me put on a couple different styles of shirts before we found a short sleeve button up in the same color. Mom spun me around to see how it fit and NL was beaming. She then told me about her daughter, daughter in law and grandson and told me that I was gonna make a lovely parent one day too, if that's what I want (it is!) and then she told us that God loves us and is smiling down on us (we aren't Christian, but the thought is still lovely) and went on her way.

A couple years ago I joined a FB movement called the Kindness Riot. Everyone involved pledged to do something to make the world a better place. I have 4 children and work, so my time is very limited. I ended up writing 10 random texts every day for a month. All with positive messages: ""You matter to me"" ""Hope you're having a wonderful day"" ""Someone loves you"" ""You are amazing"" etc. I was told off a time a two lol, but mostly people asked who I was since they didn't recognize the number, many thanked me when I said I just thought someone with that phone number needed some kindness. Sometimes I wrote longer messages. This story stemmed from one of those. (Paraphrased since I have since changed phones and numbers and no longer have a record)

Me: I don't know you and you don't know me, but something inside my heart said to tell you how important you are. You are an amazing person with so much to offer the world. I hope you are doing well today. If not, let this little message remind you that your happiness matters to someone.

Recipient: Who is this? How did you get my number?

Me: Hello! My name is Kim. I dialed your number randomly, in hopes of spreading a little kindness. How is your day?

Recipient: Thank you, Kim. My day has been terrible. I don't really think I should talk about it to a stranger, but thank you so much for the text.

Me: I am sorry to hear that you are having a bad day. And I understand about the stranger danger! I am not offended in any way. I truly hope that whatever is going on for you has a good outcome. Best wishes!

Me: Hi, friend! How are you today?

Recipient: Not so good. 

Me: I'm so sorry. Would you like to talk about it? I'm a good listener.

During the initial ""what do we do now?"" shock, a car stopped and its driver asked if the cat is alive, then suggested that we cover our hands with something and put it on the sidewalk. I took out some tissues, but a woman from a nearby shop appeared to give us a pair of latex gloves. My fiancé caressed the cat slightly and then picked it up.

We put the cat on the sidewalk, and another girl showed up holding a cat-sized cardboard box. We put the cat into the box and she tried contacting a vet that she knew, unfortunately without success. However, another passerby with a dog told us where to find a vet in the neighbourhood so we took the cat there. Someone else told us that the cat was a stray from the neighbourhood who had been involved in accidents in the past as well.

We brought the cat to a vet, who made a very good price for us (almost the price of a cat hotel!). It's a very calm and well-mannered female cat.

I always liked the smell of it, idk why but it was like an asmr for my nose I guess haha, so we spent a few minutes over at a child’s play centre thing which had little big planet on a gaming setup so little kids could get creative, where my brother was finished we walked through the gift shop which coincidentally was next to the exit where another exhibit, a strange box that no matter what side you looked at you could only see infinite reflections of the object inside and not the other side.


For clarification the place was pretty empty and knowing the area it was no doubt like that for a while.


Next to the box was a desk with an old lady who looked pretty down and instead of following my father I asked her about it and this is the conversation.

Sol (sweet old lady) me (me duh lol)


Me “interesting box, so how does it work?” I asked and she instantly peeled up.


Sol “Well Young man it was designed by the Russians in the early 1800s as a display case to show off exotic and rare treasures”


Me “nice” I smiled 

Sol “in fact look above it and pull see the effect in full” I did so and yes it looked like a prison full of mirrors 

Me “that’s really cool”

Sol “and if you follow me you can see the effect even better” I followed her as she circled around the bow and I all honesty I’m a huge history buff and this was really cool in all honesty as no matter where you stood the illusion of constant reflections stayed 


Me “thanks, that was really interesting”

Sol “the same effect can be seen in a mosque in India if you look in the right places” I think that’s pretty much what she said “in fact you may have seen the effect just not noticed it”


Me “wow, thank you that was really interesting, better be finding my dad now see you later” I told her


Sol “it was nice meeting you young man”




I walked off and returned and felt a sense of pride as I turned back she was smiling while filling out a form.

This takes place a couple of years ago when the Hunger games were super popular and the first movies had come out recently. I liked them okay but was and still not a real fan but I knew the 4 note whistle and mocking jays in the first movie. So my parents and I were out at a fast food Italian place. We were in the sit-down part waiting for the food and I hear a little girl (6-8 maybe) talking away about hunger games and asks her dad to do the whistle. I hear the 4 note whistle and get an idea so I repeat it.

I hear the little girl gasp and her dad say ""Did you hear that? There must be a mocking jay in here."" So now for the next 45 minutes to an hour, the little girl continually asks her dad to do the whistle again and I will repeat it back even after the food comes each time the girl giggling afterward. They eventually finish their food and go to leave and I hear the girl.

""Can you do it just one more time Daddy, Please?"" Now I am able to see them since they are by the door. He looks down at his daughter, ""I don't know if the mocking jay is still here."" And of course, the little girl gives the biggest cutest eyes ever. So he does it one last time and I look right at him and whistle back.

Backstory: So I live in a small city, we see a lot of people we know every day. When I was in elementary school, I used to walk with this nice lady and her old pit bull named Harvey. We would walk until we got to my school, then we would part. We knew each other because my grandma and grandpa introduced me to this place at a library that holds a session where you can do crafts for about 3 hours. So we talk as we knit and bead or other crafts. 

One day I wanted to try a new craft known as punch needle. I got to the library, only to be told by a really nice lady that it wasn’t even a PUNCH needle, it was for embroidery. I had a small mental breakdown in the bathroom then came back out and my mom took me home early. 

I had just spent so much money on a kit, and all the tools, and I was pretty upset. The next week, I came back and did a craft I knew pretty well, and my best friend even agreed to hang out with me there. So we where about an hour in, the nice lady hands me a real punch needle and told me she would keep a look out for a bigger one that could use yarn instead of thread. I thanked her and hugged her, and as I sat back down, she kissed me on the head and said, “your a good kid”

That’s the thing I like to think of when I’m upset with how my life it turning out. I will never forget that nice lady who will ever have a place in my heart. Oh, and so will Harvey, the other lady’s dog.

WD= awesome waiter guy
Me: Microscopic evening

Backstory: I’m in the Sierra mountains for my parents’ friend’s wedding, and kids aren’t allowed. So my parents gave me some cash and told me to get some food from the restaurant downstairs while they got drunk at a party or whatever. Also, I’ve never eaten out on my own before.

WD noticed me and brought me a menu and asked me if I wanted anything to drink, then went back to what he was doing. 

I went up and actually ordered correctly, and WD was super awesome and chill about my extreme awkwardness. He asked me if I wanted anything to drink, and even though I said no, he still brought me a cup with ice just in case (There was a soda machine so an empty cup made sense). 

I ate and paid, and when he handed me the receipt, he said he put a discount on for “being super awesome.” ",1.0,-11.0,0.0,-50.0,-15.0

In the fifth grade, a boy and a girl, Ruby (a tall redneck looking boy with black hair and glasses) and Neon (a short city girl with blonde hair and glasses) respectively, had a band class together. A few months in N gives R her phone number. They text alot, and apparently R's mom had realized something. Driving home from a concert she nudged R saying ""You must be really dim if you dont see it"" ""See what?"" ""That the girl likes you!"" ""She does not, we're just friends!"" ""Well i saw how she looked at you, and i know more about girls than you so."" Over the next few weeks R started realizing that his mom was right. He also realized he liked N too. He built up courage to talk to her about it, and asked her (over text, he wasnt THAT brave) ""Hey I was wondering, if you were dating anyone?"" ""No. Why are you asking?"" Well I was wanting to ask you If."" ""If what?"" ""If you would like to go somewhere as like a date?"" ""Yeah that sounds like fun!"" He was surprised and bewildered. He couldn't believe it. She had actually said yes! He was ecstatic, they stayed up until three in the morning figuring out the details, and decided to go see Jurassic World in theaters. When her parents dropped them off they had an hour before the movie so they walked around the mall. N bought them both mood necklaces with their first initial on them. R wore that necklace for years. But they then went and watched the movie, and afterwards N's parents pulled up with matching Jurassic World posters. They continued to go on dates almost every week (getting weird looks from alot of people as he looked years older than her) until 8th grade. He had to switch schools because of a high school prep program. After the program they both went to the same highschool, they were in the same percussion ensemble, same math, and same science. But everything was different. He was friends with the hood kids who smoked pot, drank, and partied. She was friends with the preps who never did anything wrong. He had low grades and she was in the honour roll. She lived in a nice house with a loving family on the good end of town, and he lived in a crappy house with a family who hated each other, on the end of town where people got shot every day. He drank himself under the table and she did her homework. They argued all the time, never went out on dates, and rarely saw each other. Then one day she had enough. She told me that she felt as if we werent even friends anymore. She said she couldnt take it. She told him they should split up. He was devastated. He never cried, but that night he cried in his mothers arms. Bawling like a baby, the whole time he told himself ""its my fault"" ""real men dont cry, so stop"" ""i drove her away"" ""i hurt her"" and so many other things. Months later he tried to date again, and dated three girls before he decided he couldnt. Ruby couldn't understand what was wrong. He didnt love any of those girls, and he couldn't figure out why. He started drinking again, and ended up texting Neon. ""Hey. Im sorry for everything i put you through. Im sorry i couldn't be there for you when you needed me. I broke my promise i made all those years ago. Im sorry. And i understand."" She text back telling him ""Its not all your fault. You have a different life. You dont have to apologize."" A few months later Ruby and Neon started talking again. Not as Girlfriend and Boyfriend, but as friends. A few months before Junior year, he invited her to go get coffee. She said she would love to go. When he got to her house they were both shaking, talkative, and really nervous. After they got coffee they walked to the gas station and bought some water and monsters for later. They spent the rest of the day at her house watching TV and talking. That day was today. I still love her, but have no clue if she feels the same. Im sorry for what i put her through, and wish i could have been a better boyfriend, but im hoping to make it up by just being her friend. She will always be the love of my life. But i wont make her love me. I wont do that to her again. Im better, i dont drink anymore. Although she never knew i did. Its something im very ashamed of.

Mandatory warning: I’m newish to Reddit and this is my first post ever to Reddit so conservative criticism is appreciated.

Back story: In the 6th grade I had to move away over thanksgiving break due to financial issues. I had 3 friends but we were thick as thieves so I was going to miss them, but I didn’t think most of the school would have noticed that I had moved away.

Any way on the last week had at that middle school everyone in my first period class had signed a giant poster board as a gift also gave me pens for others to sign it as well. 

Over the last week I lugged that thing around and just about everyone I knew at that school sighed that including people and staff I did not know well. It meant so much to know the impact I had on the school.

So ever since when ever a student, teacher, or staff member had to leave in the middle of the school year I would do something similar just to let them know what great person they were.

TDLR I had to move in the middle of the school year and got a giant poster board with signatures and ever since I try to do something similar for students, teachers, or staff members.

527,191,191happy,happy,"Ahhhh, ok, I just wanted to share about my basketball coach, who is probably one of the main reasons I'm still here today

To preface this, let me tell you a bit about myself, just to paint this picture a little better. I have gross and fine motor delay (which I'm happy to answer questions about in the comments) and multiple physical issues in my leg muscles, joints, and spine, all of which contribute to making me an incredibly unathletic and uncoordinated person. In other words, *I am not someone who should still be on a basketball team.* So, when I went out for a basketball team the spring before my high school year, I was trying to be realistic. I knew I would be cut in the Fall, but I wanted to enjoy what time I had left with my favorite sport. However, my coach had other ideas.  


She would show up early to help me work on my shooting form and stay late to make sure I understood a play, even if that meant having me follow behind her in the middle of a drill so I could see how I should be moving (something that's really helpful for me because I have issues understanding how to move myself). However, even with all that extra work, I was still the last person off the bench. When the time came for my post-season meeting, my coach cried when she told me I was going to be cut, and I've never heard someone say ""Yes!"" faster than she did after I asked if I could manage the team.  


I've been managing for her for a few years now, and not a day has passed by where she has not told me that she appreciates me.

Anyway... 

I've always had dogs. I grew up around them, was lucky enough to have a wonderful best friend of a dog who loved me unconditionally until he passed away at 13 and 3/4. My family got a Dalmatian puppy whom I absolutely adored, and missed her horribly the minute I moved away to mainland Europe to live with my husband. I see her every time I go home, and make sure to make up for my absence with many cuddles!

I spent the first couple of months living in my new country working on our new house and missing my doggo, but his family's cats were so kind to me. At the time, I was suffering from undiagnosed, untreated endometriosis, and I can't thank those sweet cats enough for teaching me how kind cats can really be. They bullied me out of bed to get myself (and them!) fed, they cuddled and purred on me, and spent time with me whilst my husband was at work. It was nice, but not the same as my big silly Dalmatian girl. 

We moved in, sheltered some very special neighbourhood cats for a while, and they taught me that if you earn a cat's trust, you get unbelievable rewards in return. I'm used to the instant devotion a dog shows, but the friendly neighbourhood cats taught me that devotion comes in many forms. After the house was finally finished (and cat proof!), my husband and I decided it was time for a cat of our own. I'd wanted a dog, but my health wasn't good enough for one. 

The first of our two boys was dumped in an animal shelter for being a problem child. Ziggy was apparently aggressive when playing, shouldn't be let anywhere near children, was a curtain and furniture shredder, and generally an all-round delinquent. He walked right up to me in the shelter, tail up like he recognised me, and purred his little furry head off. He cuddled up to my husband, was gentle when playing with another, tinier, kitten, and I fell in love instantly. My husband did too. 

When we brought Ziggy home, he purred non-stop for four days. He followed me from room to room, yelling if he couldn't see me. He was actually very good in the house, no wrecking of my curtains or furniture, and was surprisingly gentle whilst playing. I was angry with the previous owners for telling the shelter a pack of lies: my husband observes daily that Ziggy is incredibly gentle, using his paws to tap us if he wants to see what's in our hands, claws firmly in and eyes staring up adoringly. Being half Norwegian Forest cat, he's grown rapidly, and there is fluffy hair EVERYWHERE... but I don't care. I've lived through Labrador retriever shedding seasons, I've had worse! 

Ziggy is not just special because he is the exact opposite to his reputation, but he's also a therapy cat by accident. He has alerted my husband twice now when I've fainted (low blood sugar, we don't know why I have it), he's cuddled me through panic attacks, and when my endometriosis has been incredibly painful, he's been there to snuggle up and heat up all the sore bits. He also rescued his brother from strangling by alerting us that something was wrong, and we got there in time to cut him loose. He's a special boy in every way. 

Teller, my other cat, came as a bolt from the blue. His story starts off rather sad and upsetting, but don't worry, he has the happiest ending. 

My sister works abroad in Cyprus, and was having a nice evening stroll with her boyfriend. She saw a group of boys, roughly 9-13 ish years old, pushing a small toy stroller/pram around with them. She was absolutely sure she could see something in the pram, so she went over and saw that the boys had been pushing around a tiny kitten. It was filthy, shaking, and clearly traumatised. 

My sister is a teacher, and was immediately suspicious of the boys' motives due to the shady way they'd begun to act. She questioned them in her best teacher voice, and in broken English, they told her that there had been a box in the street that said ""Free kittens please take"", and the tiny cat had been in that box. When she learnt that the boys didn't have any plans to take the kitten to a shelter or rescue organisation, my sister scooped him up and told the boys she'd take him home. She did. 

My sister and her awesome boyfriend looked after the little bean beautifully. At first, he was starving, hissy, and full of fleas. When they took him to a trusted veterinarian that my sister's boyfriend uses for the family dog, the vet explained that the kitten also had the beginnings of cat flu, and needed a course of antibiotics to get him on the road to recovery. Between them, my sister and her boyfriend worked all hours of the day and night, so they knew that they couldn't keep the kitten. Teller, unfortunately, didn't get taken in by their friends, and both were worried as he wasn't getting enough social time with them. As a result, he'd keep them up all night: not ideal when you both work in the entertainment industry and need a lot of sleep. 

My husband and I were helping them with their new tiny charge, and had been providing advice for them. We'd both got very attached to Teller, so when my sister asked if we could adopt him... We said yes! 

I flew out to Cyprus, spent a lovely time with my sis and her boyfriend, cuddled and played with the new kitten and made sure to enjoy the beaches. My sister, of course, was very sad to see him leave, but so happy that he was going to a good home with people she loves. 

Teller is a fiesty, rambunctious little cat with attitude to spare, but a soft spot a mile wide. He's intelligent, bold, playful and very independent... That is, until you realise that he adores cuddles! He's spent hours snuggling on my lap, loves to sleep on or in-between people on the bed (ours or the guest bed!), and is becoming a well-rounded and sweet little lad. He's kept his dinky stature (Cypriot cats are diminutive in height), but his personality more than makes up for it! 

The two of them very much consider each other to be brothers, and they're absolutely bonded. They wrestle and play-fight like litter mates, they groom and cuddle each other, and they entertain me and my husband non-stop. 

I hope that made you smile, and please feel free to visit my profile to see photos. They're incredibly special cats, and I'm very lucky to own them.",1.0,-141.0,-102.0,0.0,-105.0

My father has nothing to do with my life and is why I’m violent, he’s selfish and though I was a trophy to him, thus meaning me and my mother left him when I was three. This caused my SPD to trigger, luckily my friend was *online* at the moment as I had been playing Monster Hunter. It was the first game I got without my dad forcing me to do what he want in his way, and my friend said to me: “Your dad is just another person in your life, not family, a real father would praise you and help you with your medical disorders, like your metabolism and SPD, which *HE* caused. Tell him to f*ck off because he is nothing in the world, a speck of dust in the universe. (I took astronomy so him talking about it made me feel better).” After he said this he has to log off, I was in tears and could play so he moved my character using attacks placed a bomb and let me finish the quest. We finished the quest and I got the platinum award. If he hadn’t said what he said I would have the courage to continue playing and I wouldn’t of had the platinum award. Monster Hunter being the game that it is, my emotional support, my dad nearly made me hate it because he thinks *IM* a trophy would of made me quit the game for good. Breaking me. But one sentence can inspire me. After we got the award I said to him: “Go raibh maith agat.” He is from Ireland and if it wasn’t for him my self-esteem would be low and my SPD making me violent.

531,195,195happy,happy,"Context: I'm a 16 about to be 17 year old black girl with a deep love for both theater and and jazz especially from the 1920-40's it is my favorite genre of music and I sing it all the time (whether there's an audience or not but I usually love spectators). I'm also very sociable and excitable due to my ADHD which also leads to me being extremely talkative. This makes it a bit hard for me to connect with my peers, I have friends that love preforming, theater and singing as much as I do but they don't understand why I would sing Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald and its too hard to explain. I stopped trying to explain because I mean it is a bit weird to be a person of my looks and love the likes Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald when we have excellent pop music and others of the like today. Another thing I connect well with older people especially after my grandmother's death. And big surprise there's a lot of overlap between older people and 1920's-40's music. These are just some stories that came to mind this evening and you'll see why in a bit

Story 1: My mom had continued a tradition started by my grandma that my family this time around me, my brother, her, and my grandma would go to see the Rockettes in NY. So I was about 9-10 that particular year and my grandma and I were waiting on a street corner after the show waiting for my mom to get the car and pull it around. My grandma and I were talking, about what I don't know and we ended up on the topic of Christmas carols. She sang ""Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire"" and I loved it, she wasn't the number 1 best singer but it was still beautiful. I remember asking her to sing the song over and over again. In my little kid mind I had visualized something sort of out of the movies where people passing by would hear and gather around and sing with us. As much as I wish that had happened it didn't instead I listened to my grandma sing one of my now favorite Christmas carols. (There are more stories like this but this one stuck out the most)

Story 2: This has nothing to do with music but my grandma was in nursing home for a brief period of time due to recovering from chemotherapy. The nursing home was right next to my school so everyday after school I would walk over and spend time with her. There was this really old woman in the hallway and she was always alone with no one to talk to her. Every once in a while I would have to pass by this woman when walking down the hall and she occasionally stopped me and my brother to talk. After we would finish talking to her and walk away (we were sometimes a bit hasty and rude about it and I still and probably will always feel guilty about it) I would here her say ""Thank you for talking to me"" and it sort of hit me how lonely this woman must be. I doubt she's still alive but I hope she had a peaceful death and has a peaceful existence in Heaven.

Finally Story 3 and the one that sparked this entire thing since it just happened: I am an alumni for a leadership program and they needed a speaker to give a few brief words on behalf of the previous years (mine class was 2011) congratulating them on graduating. It actually was not originally planned for me to go and talk in fact I wasn't aware of a graduation but because for some reason the speaker was not going to be there and I was asked last minute by my mom's friend  and had only a few minutes to make a proper speech. As if a reward for my stress MF took me to her house to celebrate her grandmother's 80th birthday.  When it was time to go home the grandmother drove me and, like I always do, began singing Ella Fitzgerald. I hadn't noticed until my playlist switched to ""Blue Moon"" that the grandmother was *singing* with me. (She was fairly quiet and I had an earbud in a bit loud) and me being me I get bold when I realize I have an audience. I switched to ""Cheek to  Cheek"" and she sang along as well. For the rest of the drive it was me basically singing Ella Fitzgerald to two very tired men in the backseat to sleep and entertaining an 80 year old black woman who, from the sounds of it, enjoyed every moment. I almost cried that after the probably excellent day this woman had (I mean we had lobster for dinner I think that a fair guess) I was able to make her day even better by singing the music I love so much. I love preforming and making people happy  especially since my grandma had died, who was basically the person (most likely unintentionally) lit the spark for me to explore her music, I am glowing when I can make older people with music they makes them think to their youth and bring them so much joy",1.0,-3.0,-52.0,-250.0,-120.0

Let us commence the story......

I was at home with my dogs around me with one of them really sick..... he was dying, there had been many attempts to help him but the vet said that he wouldn't make it past the night, so I brought him back home and spent as much time with him as possible...
When the moment came I was crying my eyes out I showed the other dogs they're brother to let them have a last good bye

533,197,197happy,happy,"I listen to an artist called Girl in Red and her music has inspired me for a long time. My mom surprised me with tickets to a festival where she was playing (Vervenfeativalen). I was of course excited about it. The concert was 18:00, so we got to see other concerts that were earlier. 

I was in front of the stage at the sound test. I began to get nervous. There were just a few people there, which meant that there weren’t many other people to look at other than me. Nothing much happened until the concert was about to start. 

I was still standing at the front when the concert started. I had already hyped myself up a bunch. Then Girl in Red came out on the stage. I got so excited and happy that I wanted to sit down and cry my heart out. I had to squeeze my thumb until it turned red. I cried a bit, but I managed to hold most of it in. It got harder as more and more iconic songs for played and people became more and more invested. 

I was shaking at the end of the concert. It was so much fun. I became too happy. It was amazing. I hadn’t felt happy, and nonetheless that happy, for at least months.

A few years ago an account on Instagram followed me, this person posted quotes which were sad, deep etc... I didn’t think anything of it and moved on, followed them back to be nice. 
I didn’t really see their posts anymore as my page grew and I began following new bands, new meme pages and my new friends. 
For some reason, one of their posts popped up in my feed at the beginning of 2019. I checked out their profile, noticed some pictures of arms with cuts and scars on them. I decided to dm them. Felt stupid for not speaking to them when they followed me, but anyway, spoke to them, told them that I’m there if they wanted to talk and that I’m always willing to help. They told me to speak to them on their main account. So I followed and here’s the turning point I guess, it was a girl, probably one year older than me, she seemed so happy in her posts. Then I realized, we will never know what others go through (most of the time). This realization hit me pretty hard because I’m apathetic and careless most of the time... This girl seemed to be okay, so happy, full of life, but her second account said otherwise. I learned that she had a boyfriend, tons of friends, she seemed to be perfectly fine.

Me: large hairy man
Gm: girls mom 
Sg: sweet girl

 I volunteer at a food bank that has a big event once a month called distribution week. It's where people who qualify can get the food they need for the month. And on occasion we have a small box of random candy we find that we give to kids with parents permission of course. I was at the first table in line explaining to people how stuff worked and sending them down the line. It was about halfway through the day when a large family of 2 mouthers and 6 kids came through. The adults didn't know to much English as they had just come to the usa and weren't doing well in the December wether as they all were in big coats.

 I asked both mom's if the pack of knee highs would want so sweets and they said yes. So I spent some time holding the box out making sure they all got one before I put it back behind me. When they were done I put it away but a little girl in the cart didn't appear to want anything and was looking at her mom something saying ""kneepop"". I didn't understand what that meant so looked to see if she wanted something on the table and I saw she was pointing at the knitted hats on my table and thought she wanted one. I spent some time helping the family pick one out for each kid. Even getting a really cute sparkling purple one for the cart girl that kinda matched her mother's head wrap (sorry I didn't know the name for it ). 

All warm and ready I sent them down the line except the little girl kept looking at her mom saying "" kneepop kneepop kneepop"". I didn't think much of it cuz I was used to cranky kids in the line. I thought it was over till her mom came back up the line 15 minutes later the little girl next to her and pointing at me saying ""kneepop kneepop"". (This is what our conversation went like)

Sg:  kneepop

Gm: I'm sorry she wants (points at something )

Me: oh she wants a did she want the pink hat 

Gm: no sorry she wants sweet

Sg: kneepop 

Me:* grabs the box and picks up a random chocolate* of you wanted this one

Sg: * shakes head no* kneepop 

Gm: she wants the umm stick one 

It was then I realized that kneepop was her world for lollipop and she had seen the only lollipop in the box but couldn't grab it in time. I then dig it out of the box to see her with a sweet smile nodding and saying excited ""kneepop"". I hand it to her with a apology for the mishap. the little girl gives me a happy thank you in the way that could melt glaciers before they make their way back to the other down the line.

He could have killed me for free loot,but he didnt even shoot in my direction and i think that one got my trust on him. After i recovered we went back to farming,but he had network problems and suddenly stopped. I got what was going on,and i remember when i was spared by him, and it was that situation turned around so i defended him with my life but nothing really happend...

So a little back story. I am now 30 but have been metal detecting as a hobby for 20 years and have found amazing items laying in the dirt. 

So on to the story. 
The cast:
CN-Crazy Neighbor
AN-Awesome Neighbor
PO-Cop
Me- I will not abuse your intellect. Lol

So my family and I had just recently moved into this small neighborhood in Oklahoma City. Anytime I move anywhere I always have to pull out my trusty metal detector and do some therapeutic digging. 

I had seen my neighbor lady and asked her if I could dig in her yard the following day since I was off work.

Me-Hey AN! I was wondering if tomorrow I could do some metal detecting in your yard? I can even show you the items I dig up.

AN-Sure! I have always wondered what was in my yard. My dad used to do that, but he died before he had the chance. I am working tomorrow, but you have my permission to dig as long as you fill in your holes.

Me- No problem. I'm sorry about your father.

AN-Its ok. Its nice to meet our new neighbors anyways. 

So the next day after getting up, I went next door and layed my coil to the soil and started detecting. I found several wheat back pennies and silver dimes. (Wheat back pennies were minted 1909 to 1958 for those who don't know)

Just about the time I was halfway done with the front yard I hear through my head phones...

CN-Hey A$$hole!

I popped my head up and took off my headphones to see if someone was talking to me.

Me-I'm sorry? Who are you and why are you yelling at me like that?

CN-If you don't get off that property I'm calling the police! Your trespassing and destroying her property you peice of S;&@.

Me-Um I'm sorry but first of all I have permission to be here. You don't have any right to scream at me! You need something all you have to do is ask. 

CN started at me on AN yard, yelling he's going to beat my A$$.

Me-You step any farther and I'll excersize my right to defend myself!

CN-I'm calling the police! Your going to get arrested!

Me-That's fine. Go right on ahead. I'll keep digging and I'll let the cops know you threatened to hit me!

CN headed back to his house and about 10 minutes later 2 cop cars pull up. Lol. 

PO-Excuse me sir. We got a call from a neighbor that your trespassing on private property.

Me-No sir. I'm sorry you had to waste your time for this. I had gotten permission from my neighbor here to metal detect her yard yesterday. CN came outside and started cussing at me and threatened to beat me without even asking if I had permission. Even after I told him I had permission he still threatened me. 

PO-Is it that neighbor? Pointing across the street.

Me- yes it was.

PO-I figured. He's a troublemaker. We get several calls from him quite often. Normally we just tell people to pay no mind to him. If he causes anymore trouble just call us.

CN-Why aren't y'all going to arrest him?! He's trespassing!

PO-CN we already talked to AN and she gave him her permission. So their has been no crime commited.

At this time CN started cussing up a storm and such that PO finally had enough and had him arrested for disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace, threatening physical harm to someone and making a false police report.

After taking my statement and such they left with CN in tow. Didn't see him again outside his home.

Also I had found a 1940s Cub Scout pin that had turned out to be AN fathers when he was a kid. She cried and thanked me after I put it into a frame with a picture of the old 1940s Cub Scouts of America logo.

So we walk over to get a ticket and the way we do it is my mom pays for the ticket while J and I wait in line cause he doesn’t handle lines very well so after mom got our ticket, we handed it to the person collecting the tickets, and got on one of the very few seated (non horse) parts and there was a lot of people that day so both of the seated ones were already taken up. We were just about to leave when a man and his daughter both get up and move to a horse
Man: here you can have this seat he (J) looks pretty excited 
After thanking his profusely we got on and had a great time going around and waving to my mom (J also loves waving to other people and blowing kisses at them too it’s adorable) so once the ride was over we got in line for a second spin and my mom is talking to his guy who is now collecting the tickets- we’ll call him M-
M: hey buddy! I haven’t seen you in ages! 
He starts talking to J and I realize that M used to go to J’s school. He lets us on the carousel twice more and we didn’t have to pay for a ticket all because he was so excited to see J and see him doing well. J was having a blast and communicating with M in his own way which was just cute to see J be so excited about seeing someone. M ended up giving us two free balloons with a promise that we come back and visit him next time. Now every time we go we visit M at the carousel.",1.0,24.0,-44.0,0.0,-45.0

I had a CW who had special needs. Our grocery store regularly employed people with special needs. She also suffered from seizures. We were both baggers/cart gatherers, and I was also the utility clerk (janitor).

One day we were sent out to get carts. This wasn't uncommon, and I had gone to a cart corral to gather a bunch together to start the process. I looked down the strip and found a bunch of people gathered around and a car partially pulled out from its space. I went down to find out what was going on. CW was on the ground, C1 had her head in her hands.

Me: Did she have a seizure?

C1: Yes, I called 911.

C2: I  looked on her emergency alert  bracelet (bracelet some people wear that tells what their health condition are, what medicines they're allergic to, emergency contact numbers) and called her mother.

Me: Did you call the store?

C1: No.

I took out my phone and called the store. Me: CW has had a seizure in the parking lot.

PM: What?!

Me: CW has had a seizure in the parking lot. We've called 911 and her Mother. Letting you know.

PM: Okay.

A few minutes later the Pharmacist came out to check up on CW. An ambulance showed up not much later, and CW went to the hospital. Turns out, PM had panicked when I told him about what happened. Fortunately, another Manager was there and knew what to do and contacted the Pharmacist to let her know she was needed in the parking lot.

These customers were great! I'm amazed every time I think about it because they all stopped what they were doing (there were about 20 people gathered around) to help and make sure no one accidentally ran over her!

Story:

One day, I went to summer camp, and it was the last day of it, so I knew I had little time to confess, so at the end of the day, I told her: (exact words, I was mainly filled in from my mom and she had good memory)

Me: C, I love you, will you be my love?

P: Aww (about 10-15 people, including mine and C's mom)

C: No, sorry.

Me: C you broke my heart.

Hotel: oof. Trivago.

Me: *walks away starting to cry*

So later, my mom took me to some place that rhymes with dac monalds, which was my favorite place to eat.at the time, and I get my usual, a cheeseburger without anything else, Don't judge me, I was young. So we sit down and start eating, and this is the conversation me and m have.

M: well look over there *points to a table*

Hi all, before the story I have to tell you about my medical history. I have ADHD and sometimes I can feel tendencies of my medical problem come back. Examples: when I see kids run sometimes, a small part of me wants to run too but I know if I run, I won't have energy later or when I hear a song I know, I used to sing in public but now am self-conscious as others may prefer the original song as I like to sing in part. I used to have to take medication (**Dextroamphetamine)** and this is used to force concentration for 4 hours per half tablet and that was the dosage I was taking. On to the Story:

Cast: EK = Entitled kid EM = Entitled mum ET = English teacher C = coach me = My Ear

During year 8, (Sec 1 or 1st year of junior high) I had a bully who knew I had this medication in my special sandwich (sugarloaf) and sometimes would exploit me for my medication during the exams time. Sometimes I just squash the sandwich into an edible ball and force the ball into my mouth but one day He took the sandwich before I could squash it and he just ate it.

I knew from the first time I took the medication, you feel really high and ready to concentrate but the hangover from the medication was terrible. you have a splitting migraine and you are really sensitive to sound, light, and smell. Once since I got used to the medication, the only hangover effect I still can remember was enhanced smelling. I remember 1 saturday, as I just woke up and still in my bed when, suddenly I could smell curry leave and lemongrass, uncut. Then I knew my mum was cooking curry that day but back to the story:

As it was the first time taking my type of pill, he had a slightly longer dose. As I was heading home, I saw my bully, thanking the teacher while behaving like a goody-two-shoes as he was also heading home.

Next day, before school started, my bully's teacher asked my homeroom teacher if I was allowed to have a word with him, she agreed as I walked and chatted with him. He was the head English teacher and he was also a counsellor, he also knew the students that had ""problems"" and had needed medication. He questioned me if bully had taken anything from me, I asked him ""If he did, was I in trouble?"" He told me to answer truthfully and I told him about my sandwich and the pill and how it was difficult to concentrate in Chinese yesterday but since I'm from Singapore, I just pushed through. He then commented ""No wonder that little bastard was a kiss ass, yesterday,"" He told me I may need to stay back in school a little, then i reminded him that classes ended at 12 as there were sports from 1 to 5. He told me he'll talk to my couch that I could go off earlier as he and I had a meeting with EM. Day went normal until we meet for sports and the coach approached me, ""ET told me you had an incident with EK, you can leave at 4.""

Everything was well then C reminded me I had to report to ET office and told me to leave earlier as I had to shower (I smelled) and luckily I had the time to calm down from the anxiety from meeting a parent, thought I was going to be in trouble. I arrive at ET office around 4:15, he welcomed me and told me not to worry, I was the victim.

I saw the clock slowly moved from 4:15 to 4:30 then to 4:45, then I heard the EM stumbling into the teacher's office with EK in tow. When EM arrive at ET's office, I was still outside ET's office as I saw EK smirk thinking I was in trouble. I couldn't hear what was happening in the office but then EM exited the office came down to my height and asked:

EM: Did my son take your sandwich?

I nodded and was surprised at what happened next. I receive a gigantic hug. I was shocked why then she told me to enter ET's office.

ET had explained to EK what was happening to him as he took the pill, then ET looked at me and then told EK to thank me. Why? Why was EK going to thank me?

ET had suspected EK had ADHD and realize that after taking my pill, his attitude and concentration had changed like a kid with ADHD. EM had suspected too but every time EK was tested, he seems fine but yesterday was different. Normally EK would be struggling to sit at his desk to do his homework but yesterday, without EM having to scream at EK, EK started doing his homework on his own and had completed it without distraction.

Although this meant that EK and I were going to have a class together (Special Needs class) this meant my bully has turned into a friend but that also came with consequences for another story

This happened over 15 years ago so the details may be sort of unclear

It was a mom, dad, and two boys, one was about 5 or 6 and the other was around 7 or 8. The parents were lovely people. Very sweet, very polite, and just extremely pleasant to be around. The kids were just solid gold. They had the best manners I've ever seen any kids have, and they were just wonderful. 

It was pretty obvious that the boys were adopted because both parents were white, light haired and blue eyed, but both of the boys were black. They seemed like a genuinely happy family.

I had waited on this family several times and got to know them a little bit. One evening they came in and had their meals, then ordered dessert. It was out of the ordinary because in all of the times I've waited on them they had never gotten dessert. But I don't think much of it and go and fix their desserts and bring them out.

Me: ""That's cool. What are you celebrating?""

I used to work as a cashier at Knotts Berry Farm in a small souvenir shop that sold jungle related memorabilia. One day, I had just come in to relieve my co-worker's shift. She was leaving with her till in hand and I was carrying a new cash till over to insert into the register. I noticed there was an elementary school group of students browsing around while their teacher kind of hovered around nearby. I was always nervous with large crowds like this, because it's really easy for people to steal while using their friends as a shield to hide their activities. I wasn't about to drop my guard just because their teacher was there. I guess I was paying too much attention to the kids and not enough to where I was going because I suddenly tripped and dropped my till, causing tons of loose change to fly everywhere. I internally cringed as this was the perfect opportunity for some entitled brats to scoop up what they could and run off with it. Surprise, surprise, as soon as the cash started rolling LG dived down to collect as many as she could.

**Me** (trying not to panic): Sweety, that's not-

I was about to say ""That's not yours"" but before I could finish the sentence, LG had dumped what was in her hand into my till and ran off to collect more coins. I was dumbfounded and sat there watching her for a disbelieving minute, before I started gathering up the ones nearby as well. The rest of her class either just stared at us or ignored us, but nobody else moved to help. Once I was fairly certain I'd gotten it all back, I thanked LG and she just smiled and went back to browsing with her class.

I was so touched by her selfless gesture that I wanted to do something for her in return. After setting up my till, I waited until her browsing brought her close to my register again, then gestured for her to come closer.

**Me**: Hey, thanks again for helping me. That was really nice of you.

**LG**: (smiling shyly) It's okay.

She was about to walk away again when I called her back.

**Me**: Hey! If you could have any toy in the store, which one do you like best?

**LG**: (looking confused) A toy?

**Me**: Yeah.

She looked around for a minute, considering. I then remembered there was an $80 giant giraffe plushy against the wall and briefly regretted my choice of the word 'any'. Luckily, her gaze finally came to rest on something much cheaper. She pointed to a stuffed black and white tiger toy, worth around $15 or so.

**LG**: That one.

**Me**: The tiger? You're sure?

**LG**: Yeah, it's cute.

**Me**: (smiling grandly) Bring it here, please.

She complied and handed it to me. At this point, some of her classmates and teacher had noticed our conversation and were watching with interest.

**T**: What's going on?

**Me**: (Ringing up the tiger and charging it to my debit card) This is a thank-you gift to your student for being such a nice person and being the only one who helped me when my coins fell earlier.

I handed the tiger to LG, who looked surprised, but then smiled happily.

**LG**: I can keep this?

**Me**: Of course! It's your thank-you gift.

**T**: Are you sure?

**Me**: Absolutely. She deserves it.

I could hear the other students who were watching begin to mutter among themselves, probably bummed that they'd missed out on their chance to get free stuff.

So I go to an average sized middle school. One day I was just getting lunch with my friend Ella and that’s when we found him. 

We went to get our pizza when we heard singing. We look around and we see this older lunch man singing in the most angelic voice you can imagine. Ella and I just look at each other in shock, because most of the lunch staff at our school are pretty apathetic and seem to hate their job. But not this guy. He’s singing some Italian song that we don’t know. He gives us our pizza and says “have a good lunch” in a thick Italian accent and, me and my friend are cracking up because we love this man so much. 

So after that it was a mission to become best friends with this man. It’s kind of difficult though because he tends to just have random day that he shows up. It was a couple weeks after we first saw him that we got an idea

On Valentine’s Day our school was doing this thing where, if you pay a dollar, the school will deliver a Crush soda to your crush. But it wasn’t just for crushes, you could really give them to anyone. So me and Ella had an idea. We were gonna give the man a crush soda and put our names on it so that he knew that he’s an awesome person and that he made two random teenage girls hearts melt.

But we ran into some difficulties. First, to do the crush soda thing, you have to know the persons name. Which we didn’t. So we decided kind of became stalkers and decided to ask around. Me and Ella went to our English teacher, who is this really nice middle aged woman who was so happy when she found out what we were doing. We asked her if she knew him and she said no. But she offered to email the lunch staff to see if she could find out. 

A couple days later I went to my English teacher and asked if she had any success. She said yes and that’s when I found something out.

His name is Ray. He doesn’t work at my school but he volunteers there frequently. His wife of 40 years is sick and he is caring for her. He doesn’t know how long she has left. 

This was at break so I asked her “WHERES ELLA SHE NEEDS TO KNOW THIS”. She hadn’t seen her. I went looking and when I found her I told her everything. We both felt sorry for him which only made us want to do it more. 

We went to the soda sale and got him the soda. We don’t know if he got it but we’re hopeful that he did. His visits have been less and less frequent lately and Ella and I are scared that something might have happened. But we’re trying to stay positive about it because that is what Ray would do. 

Honestly, I don’t know him personally. We’ve never talked but this man has taught me so much. He’s struggling right now. The love of his life might leave soon. And that’s scary. But he still comes to my school, full of apathetic and edgy teenagers, and serves them pizza. And he sings to them and hopes that every single person has a good lunch. He become sort of a celebrity among me and my friends. Because we all love and appreciate what he does so much. I swear, everyday that Ray is in the kitchen, serving us pizza, everyone is just that much happier.

It was in very early January, my friend and I were attending our town’s anime convention for the second day in a row. The first day was a blast as I got to meet some wonderful people, see some great shows and win my first smash ultimate tournament match (I lost the tournament but that’s not the point).

However, the second day was were things came in. I was standing in line to meet the voice of Tomura Shigaraki (My Hero Academia), Eric Vale. I stood in line for about an hour and a half waiting for him and my heart was pounding like crazy. Behind me was this really nice guy (Let’s call him CD for Cool Dude) that talked to me while we were in line. CD complimented me on my cosplay and we nerded out over anime, Nintendo and all sorts of stuff. The line finally ends and it’s my turn to get an autograph. The way it works there is you hold onto a ticket passed out to you and then hand it over. There’s a variety of free stuff the person can sign or bigger and more cool posters for money. 

There was only one problem

The person collecting the tickets said there they weren’t giving out free stuff and you had to either bring your own item or purchase something. My heart literally sank when I heard this. A few seconds in and CD steps in and says he’ll pay for a poster for me. I was shocked completely. This random person I knew for the duration of the line was willing to spend money on a poster for me. We picked out a poster which ended up being around 35 dollars and I eventually got to meet Vale and have a small conversation with him.

573,237,237happy,happy,"I don't know if this story is wholesome enough for this subreddit, but I still want to share it. This story happened several years ago, when I was in high school. I went to one of those high schools that offer a french immersion program for english teens who wanted to keep practicing the french skills they learned in elementary school (it's a requirement in my country). Since it was in a primarily english city, there weren't that many high school teachers who could teach in french, so most of them taught multiple subjects. Because of that, students in the french immersion program always have the same teachers for their french classes for their entire 4 years of high school. 

In my high school, we had these two really great teachers. Lets call them Mrs. B and Mrs. H for short. Everyone in my class loved them. Even though they were teaching multiple subjects to us, it was obvious that they were passionate about teaching and the subjects they were teaching. They would both talk at length about it and actively get the class involved with activities, even saying their own opinions and comments about the subject being taught. Most of the time it was funny sarcastic comments about a stupid decision a book character made, or about how the Bible is organized. They would also poke fun at themselves and their students in harmless ways. Not only that, but they also genuinely cared about their students and do whatever they can to help them, like allowing a clearly distressed student to skip class so that she can go speak to a school councillor, or giving bottles of medicated shampoo to a student with lice who couldn't afford those pricey shampoos. Their classes were always a blast of laughter and smiles, and everyone loved them.

At the end of our last year in high school, my class wanted to thank Mrs.B and Mrs.H for being such amazing teachers, and for sticking through our teen shenanigans  for the past 4 years. We all knew that it's not easy to teach a bunch of rowdy, inexperienced teens, let alone the same groups of rowdy teens every year. Simply giving a thank you card wasn't good enough to express our gratitude towards them. So, we pooled our money together and bought each of them a big bouquet of roses. One rose from every student, which means they each got a bouquet of 20+ roses. And we wanted to give them with a big surprise. 

Our classes with Mrs.B and Mrs.H were our two last classes of the day, right after our lunch break, with Mrs.B being first, followed by our joint class with Mrs.H. On our last day of school, during our lunch break, we snuk into the classroom and started decorating it, writing a big and colourful ""Thank You"" on the white board. Then, we stood at the front of the class, turned off the lights, and waited for Mrs.B to arrive at the start of the class. She eventually does arrive, and got a little suspicious that the lights were off when there should've been a class full of students. She turns it on, and we yell ""Surprise!"" She jumped a little, and looked a little confused. Then, it registered in her head what was going on, and smiled from ear to ear. During our 4 years with her, we never saw her with such a big smile. The rest of that class was spent taking pictures, and giving Mrs. B the roses and thanking her for all of her hard work. Now it was time for Mrs.H's surprise.

Since Mrs.H's class was a joint class with the grade below us, and they didn't know of our plan, so we couldn't risk doing the ""turn on the light surprise"" for fear that one of the students would turn on the light and spoil the surprise for Mrs.H. So, we hid in the class next door until the class started. The teacher was cool with it, since were won't be staying there for long. Mrs.H entered her classroom and got confused about why only half the class were present, and why its only the graduating half that is missing. She asks Mrs.B, who was quietly working at her desk in the back, and, being the champ that she is, pretended to not know where we were. She also hid her bouquet of roses, too. Mrs.H, still confused, started the lesson. Shortly after, my class walks into the classroom, in line, and we also gave her our roses and said thank you and how much we appreciate her. She was just as happy as Mrs.B, and was almost in tears. She said how much she would miss us after we graduate, and then composed herself to teach this final lesson.

I don't know if Mrs.B and Mrs.H are still teaching at that school or not, or what they did with those roses, but I still remember that day fondly. Great teachers deserve to feel appreciated by their students.",1.0,-4.0,-127.0,-50.0,-135.0

This happened when I was a just a little girl so please do not judge me now.

So here's some back story my mom needed to clean out useless junk from our house and we were struggling financially in a very small cheap house the floors were staples sticking out from where carpet was removed and we always had to get pliers if we stepped on one. We now live in a nice house with not to much money as my dad just lost his second job okay i'm sorry on the the story now: We were having a garage sale just for a bit extra money and to remove clutter we lived in a small town not to many people so it was fun but there was one thing i didnt want to sell and i cried when mom said we were going to it was a....................................... Bell!

... clap?

yeah that's it nothing special but a bell I've never seen before..                 :

okay wheres the wholesomeness? oh right in this section down here      \\/

A lady saw me playing with the bell and looking extremely sad like puppy dog eyes from a kid sad and so then she went next to me and said   (Hold on NL=Nice Lady             Me=Me     HM= Happy but knows shes gonna be annoyed a lot mom)

NL: Nice Bell! Is it yours?

Me: N-no..

NL: You want it don't you?

Me: Yeah..

NL: Okay!

She grabbed the bell from the table payed HM and handed me the bell right in from of her!

HM: ?        Oh! Thank you so much! (She looked at me) Did you say thank you? :)

NL: Ye

Me: (Interrupting like a kid) Thank you so much!!! (Hugging NL)

NL: Awwwwwww

HM: Thank you you really didn't have to-

NL: No my pleasure she looked like she really wanted it!

My mom probably doesn't even remember this but I know every detail if I come across a girl like me I'll pass on the amazing deed I wish I could say I still had the bell but after one year little me broke it:/

578,242,242happy,happy,"This story happened back in December of 2018. I had just spent a whole month with my parents in CO after not seeing them since April. I was flying back to my apartment in MS and had to pass through Dallas international airport. 

On the first flight from CO to Dallas, my flight was informed that since we had a full flight, there might be limited space in the overhead compartments. They suggested that passengers in the last few groups should check their bags in. I was carrying my cat in her carrier, my backpack, and my purse. My purse can easily fit in my backpack and it’s easier to carry my cat by herself in her carrier.

I walked to the front desk and asked to check in my backpack. I asked if I am to get my backpack in Dallas or my final destination. The flight attendant said I will retrieve it in Dallas, right outside the plane with the rest of the checked in bags. Perfect. I grab my phone, headphones, and pack of gum and check in my backpack (with my purse and boarding tickets inside of it).

Before boarding the plane, I leave my backpack where I was told to do so, and ask the man collecting them also, if I am to get this at Dallas or at my final destination. He confirmed Dallas. So I board my flight with no worries.

1 hour and 45 minutes later, we land at Dallas International Airport. My phone was at 10% (as I was watching in flight movies and listening to music). I get my cat and make sure I have my phone, headphones, and gum. I walk off the plane and wait right outside for my bag, by all the strollers, and other checked in bags. I wait, and wait, and wait.

After the last person got off and the flight attendants began to do the plane aftercare, I get their attention and ask about my bag. Everyone got theirs but mine is no where.

They inform me that all checked in bags will be collected at the final destination and my heart sinks and I can feel tears forming in my eyes. My phone is about to die, I have no form of identification, my plane tickets and money are all packed up and being taken off to my next plan. It doesn’t make any sense why mine out of all of them was kept with the regular luggage but I didn’t argue.

My layover was 4 hours. I bolt out of there to find the nearest customer service desk. I call my mom in tears and explain as fast as I can all I can do. She wishes me luck and to update her if I can.
Finally I find a help desk and wait in line behind four other people, looking just as flustered as me.

Once it was my turn, I try to explain as best I can what happened and ask if they are able to retrieve my bag. The lady behind the desk (with the most painful smile) tells me that it’ll take longer for them to get my bag than for me to get onto my next flight and get home. Basically, no, they cannot get my stuff. I just loose it and break down in tears, very much ugly crying right then and there.

I was hungry, tired, and frustrated. I started to walk away, trying to figure out how to even get on my flight when one of the people in line, a lady and her daughter hand me a $20 bill. I began to cry even more and thank them over and over again. 

I rush to the bathroom to clean myself up, so I could make a game plan for the next four hours. As I leave the bathroom, I spot the two, smile and wave at them. I went off to get food, coffee, and water.

I texted my mom what happened, loaded the plane company app, was able to get my digital boarding pass loaded. For the next four hours I chased my flight across the entire airport, as flight terminals change many times using the main screen with all the flights.

I thankfully I was able to make it on my flight and get home 2 hours after takeoff, get my luggage and backpack, just in time to charge my phone at 1%.

If I could, I want to repay that mom and daughter the $20 that they gave me. They really helped me get through that awful experience. Glad to see that there still are nice people out there.

579,243,243happy,happy,"So, this is a longer one. To get started id like to introduce my mself, as far as necessary. Im 20, male and was 6 years single. I felt really lonely for most of the time, since i had at best 3 good friends for the time, and a lot of the timenot a single one. Also i still am a virgin. A lot of that comes down to me beeing shy. So, about 2 weeks ago i was at a party with my bestfriend. I had a few drinks (drinking age of 18 here) and he saw his ex, wich he knew was single again, wich he still has feelings for. She was there with her sister. Shoulder long brown hair, brown eyes and a really happy smile. I offered him to distract her. We talk for a bit, and i offer that we go outside (since i cant really concentrate and listen at partys thanks to my ADD) it was very cold outside, but it didnt really matter because i had a really nice talk. She has a high education, is noticably very intelligent, learns and works in chemistry and pharmacy development. We talk about our jobs and hobbys and friends, and after some time her sister comes out (my buddy wasnt successful) and tells here that they have to leave since its 3am, wich ment we stood out there for 3 whole hours. I allready got her number so i huged her and told her to drive save. We went home not a lot later. I wanted to wait till evwning the next day to text her, but she found me on insta around dinner so i texted her. We talked a lot the next days, and i asked her out, kinda, it didnt work out for Wednesday, but she said that she goes karting on Friday with a few people (i love karting and she knew) and invited me. We had a lot of fun, amd went later to 2 pubs, again we talked a lot and she later drove us home, but we allready said we where going to a club the next day, that day i was driving. I picked her (and her sister) up and when we arived i got. My one single beer since we'd be staying for at least 4 hours. I was in breakdance so i have some moves, we talked again for about 2 hours, and i really felt something that time, the times before it was very nice, but this feeling was just so much more and i hadnt had it since atleast 2 years. I was in love again. I often was thinkingbif i should. Go for the kiss but i couldnt get myself to it. She danced with a mutual friend in the club, wich kinda hurted me, but i was to sober for that to be honest. I apologized to here, and told here that id love to dance, bit just cant. At that point her sister cut her ancle on a piece of glass, so we called it a night and went home. At her doori asked her if her sister was able to survive alone for a minute. Following is the cringiest minute of my life but the best since a long time. I wanted to kiss her, but instead went for a hug... Twice. Then, to kive my self a kick, i asked if it was okay for her if i kissed her, and as she said yeah i finaly got over my self... This was my first kiss in over 6 years. The next day we went hiking and today she was at my /my parents place for the first time. Shes extremly nice and smart and also hell of a lot shy. Since that party 2 weeks ago im happier, and have no urge to masturbate anymore, what sounds gross, but this was a real adiction for the last year out of lonelynes. I feel liked and apreciated again. So to all the shy guys out there. Its okay. You sre great and deserve to be loved, but sometimes you have to give yourself a kick",1.0,22.0,-67.0,-100.0,-15.0

HI, so I have just found this sub and I really like it, so I wanted to contribute my little story :-)

For most of the story, I am just an  onlooker, the wholesome person here is a friend of mine and I only play a  small part. To give context (it will be important later), I am a  language nerd. English is my second language, then I have a few more  European ones, and some two years of sign-language courses. I love to  practice any of them (I am a language teacher, so I guess it makes some  sense).

Backstory: my family has been going to the  same small seaside-town every year for over a decade. We live there at a  friends house and know most of the locals. There is a restaurant which  we love to visit, because the place is one wholesome story itself.

When  we first came to the town, we would go out for dinners (pizza etc) and  at one of the many bistros there was a really hard-working waiter. It  was a guy you would notice immediately - he was always nice, always  there, fast, polite, and really good at small-talk with guests. After a  few days we started to talk more and he told us that his ambition is to  make enough money to start his own business. Two years went by, we  became friends, he would still wait at tables at the same place, but on  the third, he had opened a tiny restaurant next to the one where he used  to work. Each year it grew, first he worked alone with just one cook,  then with more and more people to help him. It is probably the busiest  place at the beach now because of his personality (he remembers every  single person that comes) and the evident love which is in the very  foundation of the place. I don't need to say that we never go anywhere  else.

One  night we were having a dinner there when a man approached the  restaurant, putting a few trinkets and a note on each table. The note  said that he was deaf and in a tight spot, and was selling the things  which he had crafted. I have seen this many times before and am happy to  buy something, but I have also seen multiple people pretending to be  deaf, even in this very town. I have some deaf friends (thanks to the  courses) and hate people abusing this disability for profit, so I  decided to try him - I signed ""Hi! How are you?""  
The man smiled  broadly and responded, evidently happy to talk. We ended up chatting for  good 20 minutes about life and his situation - he was not doing well  financially at all. I bought a few things from him and a few people  around came to buy stuff too. Finally we said Goodbye when the  restaurant owner stopped him, handing him a paper.

I  did not see what was written there, but I saw that the man's face  completely lit up. The two shook hands and the man continued on his way.  The owner went straight to us to explain ""I have seen this guy around  here multiple times but I was never sure if he does trully have a  disability, there are so many who try to leach on people by faking. So  now that I have watched you talk, I see that he is legit. I have given  him a note to come for a free meal anytime he needs it.""

I  was so happy! I am not surprised that the restaurant is running so well  with this amount of good karma! I know that I have only contributed to a  minimal part of this good deed, but it warms my heart to remember it. I  think it is a good reminder to share your luck if you have it, and I  now use it as an example of how You speaking a language at least a bit  can help not only you, but somebody else as well.",1.0,-5.0,-82.0,-157.0,-105.0

584,248,248happy,happy,"Backgroung: My friend and I both don't drive as we are on our L's and don't have a car. We are also both from areas with notoriously bad public transport which means getting to her place takes me roughly 3 hours sometimes more. We had organised to meet up and have a sleep over since we are adults and adults are allowed to wear fuzzy pjs, have a tea party and binge watch The Librarians (on the weekends when we don't have work of course). I have not gone to her place very often as we both used to live in college together so I am relatively new to the path I need to take.

The story: So I walk to the bus stop with my big over night bag full of goodies and video games and all is going well. Except I end up having an emergency with my new lease and have to do some online banking and go on hold for a while, and also keep the GPS up cos this trip requires 4 busses and some walking between stops and I have no idea when to get on and off without my GPS giving me a buzz. This drains my battery fairly quickly and results in my phone being nearly dead when I get off the second last bus. So I write down the rest of the route on my hand and my friends address and message her to explain the situation and give her my current location and eta so she can send her dad to come and pick me up if something goes wrong. It does. No sooner do I send the message and my phone dies. I'm pretty confident things will go fine and I wait for the bus with another lady waiting for a different bus. Both busses come at the same time except hers stops and mine doesn't. The lady with me even tried to race after it to flag the bus down for me but no dice. Both her and the bus driver offer me their phones to call my friend but I didn't think to write down her phone number. The bus I needed is very infrequent and prone to simply not coming and is also every hour when it does come so the bus driver tells me to catch a different bus. I thank him and he drives off.

I'm waiting for this bus also low key hoping my friends dad will appear and save me since I'm not very confident in this other bus but trust the bus driver none the less. About maybe 20 minutes later (and I should mention this was a very hot day and there was no shade at the bus stop) a bus that says 'out of service' pulls up and opens the doors. It's bus driver from earlier! ""The bus I told you to get doesn't actually run any more, Sorry, get in"" the bus is empty because he dropped off the rest of the passengers and finished his route then came back for me. During the trip he tells me about his wife and kids and we have a good old chat. I thank him when we get to my stop and he says ""no problem, this was my good deed for the day""

586,250,250happy,happy,"For the record this is my first post. Just saying. I don't remember the exact date this happened and I was 23 at the time and my girlfriend was around 20 (We met when she was 19)

*Backstory*: My girlfriend is basically a crazy cat lady (She would be first to tell you that) she has not one, not two but FOUR cats (At the time this story takes place anyway she has more now :3) She loves those cats almost as much as me and calls them her 'babies'. The eldest cat is the mother of 2 of the others and the last cat was from another litter. I'd been with her for a just under a year but had only ever been to her house one other time, she lives with two sisters who are slightly older than her and she has three older brothers, two of which have moved out but they still talk. On that visit her cats obviously didn't know me and kept their distance from me. Which I respected since at the time I wasn't much of an animal lover and the brother who hadn't moved out yet (Lets call him Mike) wasn't home on that visit, I had met her mother and we got on pretty well

On with the actual story: It was my second visit to her place and me and my GF were sleeping together now. We were just chatting about random stuff in her room when I notice the cats had gained more confidence and were growing curious about me. The two middle aged cats (Snowball and Trixie) Were both *very* curious and prodding me with their paws and rubbing themselves on my leg. The mother cat (Bella) was being more cautious, basically she walked up to my leg, gave it a sniff and then walked away. Only the youngest cat (Jackie) was still hiding from me. I should add that apart from Bella the other cats looked pretty close together age wise, though my GF never told me their exact ages, I don't think she was quite sure herself. Also keep in mind that on my first visit to her place the cats wanted nothing to do with me.

Fast forward a few hours and we're both getting ready to sleep in her bed (Its a big bed) Now as everybody whos knows even the basic facts about cats, they are nocturnal creatures, it was about 10 or 11 o clock at night and they were WAY more active, jumping across the room, up shelves, the window sill etc. This was pissing my GF off since she was tired and just wanted some sleep, about an hour or two of this goes by and we both hear her brother outside her bedroom arguing with her mother.

My GF, who was already cross and cranky at this point gets out the bed and tells me to wait, since Mike is one of those people who would hate his sister's BF just because we're dating and hes been know to get violent even with his own family members. I'm pretty confused and worried by this point since I hadn't met or even seen the guy yet. But from what my GF had told me, he works a very physically demanding job and is built like a tank.

I was getting anxious and actually scared for my safety by this point since my GF hadn't expected him to be home by this time I he was spending the night at his own GF's place. Since the bedroom walls and door are actually pretty thick I can't hear what words are being yelled, but just from the tones and general ruckus I could tell it was a heated argument.

I sit up and I can feel myself shaking in fear, I pull the covers off myself and get my clothes ready just in case he came inside the room and saw me. (I was just preparing for a worse case scenario as I still hoped he was a reasonable guy)

this is when the cats come back in to the story; they stopped jumping around and gather onto the bed with me. Snowball then steps onto my thighs and lies on them, I could feel him purring through my PJs. Bella and Trixie both nuzzle my arms wanting a stroke and so I do, again the both of them are purring. They both then snuggle up to my sides under my arms and vibrating as they purr. Even Jackie, the formerly shy cat works up the courage to mew at me, he slowly snuggles up next to Snowball on my legs and also starts purring.

I'm starting to feel much better with all these cute cats around me and I stroke each one in turn while the argument outside kept going, I don't know how long we stayed like that, maybe half an hour. Trixie at one point even tried to climb onto my shoulder to nuzzle my face.

Eventually my GF comes back in the room, I swear I could see steam coming from her ears she was that pissed at Mike over something. But when she saw me surrounded by her cats I think her heart melted from the sight. She gave an audible 'Dawwww' seeing all her cats cuddling me.

So, this is my first time posting to the sub. But I have a whole bunch of stories I don't want to forget so I'd thought to post them here. Also, forgive me for the spacing, it makes it easier for me to read back and fix errors while typing.

When I was six or seven (around that age, forgive me for the vagueness), my family and I travelled interstate to celebrate my father's birthday. Which aligned on New Year's Eve (before you ask, yes my dad has the story of how he was born on New Years Eve ~~it's a trip though~~).

Now, this place was my great aunt's house, and needless to say, they throw the sickest of parties for every event. We are talking Easter, Halloween (one of my cousin's birthdays), Christmas and of course, New Year's.

So when my parents, my sisters and I arrived, we were greeted with my uncle's dogs -he had two-. One beautiful American Staffy and the other dog I can't remember the breed but it was one of those fluffy dog breeds, but he was named Chopper (the focus of this story).  
Now when I was young, I was afraid of my grandmother's tiny Shih-Tzu. So when I saw Chopper bounding around the corner of the entryway, I hid behind my mother's legs, terrified.

But we eventually went out into their spacious backyard and the festivities began. They had a built-in pool, a large shack at the back filled with adults that were smoking cigarettes and talking over drinks and poker. My dad turned to me and told me to ""have fun with your cousins"". I wished my dad a happy birthday and went over to my cousins.

Now around 11pm that night, I grew really tired and my older cousins seemed to notice. ""\[My name\] are you okay?"" I yawned tiredly and was stumbling. She simply laughed and kneeled down to me. ""You can sleep in my bed for now if you needed, come on, let's go to bed.""

I was a silent kid, not by choice sadly. Selective mutism ruled my childhood with an iron fist so I couldn't speak to most of my relatives. So I didn't say anything, only nodding towards her as she grabbed me by the wrist tenderly and took me to her room. I remember that it smelled lightly of perfume and the bed was a whole Queen-sized bed.

""Goodnight and Happy New Year \[my name\]."" She whispered as she tucked me in. She left the door open a crack as I fell asleep on the bed. However, I didn't know this until two day after that Chopper had entered my cousin's room as soon as I fell asleep. He laid himself in front of the bed on my side and nodded off to sleep himself.

My mum was coming in to collect me so we could go back to our other aunt's place. However, she noticed how I was asleep, with Chopper laying in front of the bed facing the doorway. Had my hand dangling over the bed, over his body, drooling on the pillows and snoring away quietly. 

However, Chopper sadly passed away of an illness I can't recall two years later. I remember being so devastated that I wanted him to come back, I refused to go to school that day he passed away. 

I'm afraid of dogs, yet I loved that dog with all of my heart. I still do, and I want to remember this story.

592,256,256happy,happy,"So, a bit of background: I'm a white male grad student in my sixth semester, and I've been growing my hair out since the start of grad school. Recently, I decided to have my hair cut short and donated, mostly because I was tired of the maintenance required to keep it neat and fed up with parts of my ponytail getting caught wrong and pulling, or coming loose and flying in my face all the time.

So on Ash Wednesday (March 6), I went into a hair salon right near my apartment. The stylist was very pleasant and supportive of my intention to donate my hair. She pulled it together into four separate braids, front and back, and cut the braids off with a trimmer. So far, so good.

While she was doing the rest of my haircut, she suddenly stopped and drew my attention to the front desk nearby. There was a gentleman there, paying for his own haircut. He noted that I was donating my hair, which I confirmed. Then, *he asked me if HE could pay for MY haircut.*

I. Was. Floored.

At first, I had no idea how to respond. I told him that he didn't have to, that I was willing and able to pay for my own haircut, but he insisted. He thanked and complimented me for doing such a kind thing for someone with hair loss. After he left, the stylist and I chatted a bit about what just happened, still amazed.

Then he *came back* and asked if he could take a picture of my braids to share on social media.

Forget *floored*, I think my jaw hit *bedrock.*

I was so stunned by this sequence of events. I didn't even try to rationalize it as just a coincidence. As I walked home, I said a very heartfelt Rosary in thanksgiving, not for the free haircut, but for the existence of such kind, generous people. I normally don't ascribe events like this to the direct action of God, but I can't help but suspect that in this instance, God was working through that gentleman to remind me of something.

Lent is traditionally observed through prayer, fasting, and almsgiving. I decided to give my excess hair to a child with hair loss. That gentleman insisted on paying for my haircut out of the goodness of his heart. And God, out of the fullness of his goodness, gave to both of us a spirit of kindness and generosity.

So I told my parents about it and told them that I was going to get new ones in a couple weeks. Then Monday morning while I was at school. I get a call down to the office because there was a social worker there who wanted to talk to me about getting new glasses. I told her,

Me: I'm saving for glasses. I was going tobget them on the 7th (when this happened it was Monday 4th) but 1: I have to work that day, and 2: my mom told me to save up.

SW: Well, we're going to pay for your glasses.

Me: *stunned, almost choked up* I feel like I should owe you something in return.

SW: The only thing you owe me is straight A's and perfect attendance.

Me: Well, you're already getting a perfect attendance out of me. (Lol)

SW: Well you keep that up and you get new glasses. I have to figure some things out at the office, after that I'll send a message to the school and all you have to do is make an appointment with the optometrist.

I've had my female cat (Belle) for 6 years. We used to spend every moment I was home with one another. 5 years later, we got my male cat, Gryffin. I didn't stop spending time with her, but I had to balance it out with Gryffin, so naturally Belle started to resent him. She hisses at him and will even try and slap him (not scratch, just SLAP).

One day, one of our dogs snuck upstairs. The dogs aren't allowed upstairs, because the cats usually stay upstairs and they were scared of them.
This was back when Gryffin was smaller, and terrified of the dogs (he's besties with both them now, even though they're like 5x as big as him aha). So Gryffin had darted into my bathroom while Luna (the dog) was hard on his paws. I went into my bathroom to find Belle standing right between the two, hissing and swiping at my dog. Luna eventually ran out, and I led her farther away so I could go back and take her downstairs later.
I went to make sure the cats were okay. They both were. Now I know cats can't feel human emotions or anything, but the next part was so real that they must.
Gryffin looked at Belle from where he hid, all surprised and thankful that she ""saved"" him (Luna isn't mean or anything, but he was small). Belle looked at him, huffed in what I'd call embarrassment and fled the scene.

Nowadays, Belle is still pretty rude to him and does still scare him off a lot, but she's gotten quite a bit gentler with him. I even saw them laying in the same bed once, just a few inches apart. Even when Belle tries to fight him, he thinks she's playing and gladly plays along. I think she enjoys it, too, but she'll never openly show it.",0.0,-33.0,0.0,0.0,-45.0

Anyway, I was standing in line about ten minutes, when another woman, also in her mid 30’s, and her daughter walked in line behind me. The only difference was, this girl looked to be about 9 or 10. She was carrying a little Elmo purse

I heard the first little girl say, “Mommy, can I have a purse like that?”, pointing at the Elmo purse. Sadness grow on her mother’s face as she said to her, “I’m sorry, honey, Mommy doesn’t have the money for things like that since Daddy died.”

The little girl just hung her head. 

My heart sank. 

Just then, the little girl standing behind me, with the Elmo purse says, “Excuse me.”, and walks past me and up to the other little girl. Apparently, she too, heard what was said. 

Anyway, she walked up to the little girl and said, “My Daddy bought this for me, before the Army sent him overseas and he died too. He taught me to share, I want you to have it”, and handed her the little Elmo purse.

She then turned around, said, “Excuse me.” again and walk back to her mother, who hugged her and said, “That was nice thing to to do.”  The little girl just smiled at her. 

The first little girl says, “Mommy look!!” With a big smile on her face. 
Her mother says, “Very nice, what do you say?” The little girl turns around and says, “Thank you.” Her mother lifted her head, and mouthed the words, “Thank you” to the second little girl.

I tried to tell her that it didn't matter and she was still was a pretty girl and as long as she was healthy ect.... She was indeed a little chubby so I thought she weight maybe 10 kg more and was upset about that but I asked her just to be sure.
 ,, I got on the scale last evening and it said 400kg''. She didn't belive me when I said that must have overlooked a point on the scale, so I told her to go on the scale after school and really look for a point between the numbers, because that means she only weighs as much the numbers before the point (I didn't want to confuse her with decimal numbers). 
The next day she came up to me and said she found the point on the scale and that she only weights 40kg with a smile on her face.

I had to let my parents know but I didn't want to admit I'd wet my aunt and uncle's bed so I told them that I had a wet dream and we'll...you know. I'm pretty sure they knew I was lying but they just went along with it and let me maintain some of my dignity.

611,275,275happy,happy,"So, currently I'm a university student, but about 6 months ago i was working at a conveyancing company in the UK. I wont use any names so OL = Older Lady, the one on the other side of the phone, TC = Terrible Conveyancer, M = Conveyancers manager and Me = Well you guessed it, Me.

At the time I was working in the Identification Team and was working to help out people who needed to sort out there ID. I had a lot of clients that drained me and some people tried doing some seriously crazy stuff, when selling their house, or buying a new one. However, this is not one of those stories, this one is from my last day working there after my 2 weeks notice, so i was leaving and moving to London for university on the weekend. (Since being at uni I've been so busy that i don't 100% so I'm paraphrasing a little, but ill only put in parts i vividly remember).

So, the story begins towards the end of my last day, i had some jobs to do but when your phone rings that the biggest priority, so i picked up the phone and this is the following conversation:

OL (audably upset): Hello, I'm trying to sell my house, but TC has told me i need to sort out my ID.

Me: Okay miss, can i get your refrence number so i can load up your file.

She gave me the number and i start to search for her file, while loading the OL is audubly upset so while my slow as computer worked though finding the file I decided that since it was my last hour at my work and that this lady was upset to ask what was wrong, I'm glad i did.

Me: Miss, may i ask whats wrong? And if there is anything I could do to help?

OL: TC has been missing deadlines, wont pick up the phone when I call, and shouted at me when I didn't understand what we needed to get.

I cant prove that TC did shout at OL but in email correspondence between the two it seemed like the conveyancer didn't seem to be trying at all, and was being very unprofessional, so I decided to help.

Me: Sorry about the wait miss, I've just had a look over the file and it appears as though we need some documents from you. Would you mind if we go over everything we can do to get this sorted out for you, then, would you be happy to tell me everything about TC.

We were only supposed to have 5 minute calls with clients, but since it was my last day i had decided to take the extra time to help, it was my very last day, what are they gonna do? Fire me?

After explaining everything we needed to sort out the Identification i offered that OL send the documents to us, we will do all the work and send them back. Then we move to the second part of our call. (Which is where this story makes me smile).

Me: So miss, we've managed to sort out your ID, if you give me a moment i can raise a formal complaint against TC on your behalf.

Were not really the ones who were meant to write up complaints, we were supposed to get a manager and then the conveyancer to call back, but the lady literally couldn't stand talking to them. I take her statement and write it into a note on the file (That's how you added complaints). Then I emailed this to M and TC too.

Me: Miss, I've loaded that complaint against TC and I have notified M as well.

OL: Thank you so much for your help.

Me: Its no problem, if there's anything else I can do for you just ask and I'll do my best.

OL: Oh thank you! I was wondering when sale will be going though, I'm selling it for my children.

Me: No worries miss, I completely understand how stressful this can be

I looked up the date of the completion and give it to OL.

Me: Now the date I've given you isn't completely set, as the complaint would have to be processed against TC, as well as the documents needing to be delivered might take a few days, but that the date will be around there soon. If a week after the date I've given you the house has not been sold call this number: (M's number) and they will be able to help you.

OL: Thank you so much you've been such a great help!

Me: Have a great day, and i hope the sale goes though fine.

The call ended and i was 15 away from leaving for the day.",0.0,-139.0,-97.0,0.0,-75.0
