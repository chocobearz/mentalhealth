0sad,sad," to be honest i dont know what to do. My family is truly breaking me and this point.

my parents like to remind me that im the smart one. ill pay for their care when they are older so i have to get a good job but anytime i bring up something im always shot down. i dont understand or im giving them attitude. 

my little sister has stolen over £200 off me over the past 5 months and anytime i bring it up. all i get is well you shouldnt have left it around. my little sister hasnt done any school work for the past month over quarantine and  they expected me to tutor her while im in sixth form studing history law and business. when i said im busy they said too bad and you have to do it and when i told them she wouldnt listen to me they said they would take her phone. my mum says my dad will take it my dad doesnt as he said its her problem if she doesnt want to do her work. this is one situation of so many. 

all my family tells my parents that she is spoiled but they say she'll grow out of it. 

my big sister is a narcissist anytime something goes wrong she throws a temper tantrum. shes 24 with a kidand they try and fix what inconvenienced her. An example of this is that my parents already paid of her debt of over £2000 less then 8 months ago and now shes in bad debt again. 

my only escape from this family has been my nan and she just diagnosed with parkinsons. i honestly dont know what to do anymore i know that they're so toxic but their still my family amd as much as they have pit me through i do love all of them so much. Though i dont think i can survive here much longer cause i generally cant remember the last time i was happy and honestly i catch myself wanting to end it all too many time to count.",-3,-5.421052632,-6.885964912,-27.16374269,-0.789473684

8sad,sad,"I guess this is mostly a rant, but I've been feeling so alone in my own head that I could really use some support. This is the first time I've ever opened up about any of this stuff. Here goes: When I was 5, I was diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome, ADHD (combined type), OCD, ODD, and manic depression. 
I am now about to turn 30 (female, FYI). These past 5 years I've been doing a lot of therapy and research to understand, for the first time In my life, what ADHD actually looks like and how it effects me. I think the more I understand, the angrier I have become about it. I'm not so sure about ODD because I haven't done any research into it, but I have recently done a lot of research on OCD and it made a lot of things make a lot of sense. At the same time, it's made me realize what a cluster f*ck I am. Oh and manic depression is now known as bipolar, which I am not (guess it's hard to tell when you are 5). My psychiatrist has given me new diagnoses of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder (in place of the manic depression/bipolar). Oh and how can I forget my complex PTSD? 
I spend the majority of my mental energy hating myself. No matter what I accomplish, I can never live up to my own expectations. And I'm always so angry that everything has to be twice as hard for me as it is for a neurotypical person. I finally made two friends who also have ADHD and I thought I'm finally not alone anymore, but I quickly realized I am way more f*cked up than they are.

19sad,sad,"Thinking it might help to just try and put my feelings down in writing.

I work with a caseload of clients (members of the public) and have a fairly high level of responsibility over what I'm assisting them with. 

I am currently working from home due to Coronavirus which I'm finding difficult in itself , it's just hard to get on with things and get into a work mindset.

I have had a look at CBT and never really intensely tried it but I do know my problems are probably cognitive distortions. IE , my work audits go well, I was recently given a payrise as I'm no longer a ""trainee"" etc. I honestly suspect my colleagues think I'm competent and hard-working and are happy to help me when I need it.

However , I'm currently sat putting off contacting clients as I always worry about messing up or feel that they will be annoyed at me for whatever reason. Fundamentaly I feel quite nervous dealing with the public and meeting them in appointment / talking on the phone etc. I just wish I could be left alone and not have the personal responsibility! I don't know what causes this nervousness , I feel like I appear weird or that that I talk oddly or something! Maybe I am just lazy and like having nothing to do

I feel like I overthink things and sit for hours worrying about problems before taking action , I ask for a lot of reassurance and feel like I think of almost every ""what if scenario!"". In my 9 months in the job , nothing has wrong yet I should add. Although if anything does come out the blue and need dealing with it always frustratingly , one of the things I HADN'T worried about.

I feel that although I really believe in what I'm doing these issues are affecting my enjoyment of the job and I always feel tense and have butterflies In my stomach throughout the work week. If for example , a receptionist calls to put a client through to me I feel mild fear. I honestly don't know what I'm worried is going to happen. I worry that I've messed up something for the client or they're calling to complain or whatever.

Does anyone have any thoughts as to how I can help myself ? I do not have crippling anxiety by any means. I function well. I just want to feel confident and to stop overthinking every thing.",-1,-11.95906433,-6.441520468,-2.312865497,-10.35087719

With COVID here I'm with my wife a lot and we have been fighting more, it's been several times now and I am realizing I'm really reactive and defensive.

I have a lot of abuse under my belt from my father and the only way I ever was able to maintain my sense of power and self was to doggedly argue and fight him. I was constantly berated, told I would be nothing, physically abused and molested. When I come under fire or perceive a threat to my esteem I react poorly. I have been better in the past but I think I'm not on top of my mental game lately.

I've been able to work through a lot of this but I feel now that I engage my wife when we argue or when I perceive her as being unfair to me like a freaking bear trap.

It doesn't even have to be something that matters, twice I have perceived her as having bad intentions or being unfair to me in the last week and instigated a fight with her.

Literally today I started a fight about her asking me to take a Zoom call on headphones, I decided she was being inconsiderate to ask me to do that because she takes her calls in central space and off of headphones (I'm usually asleep I work nights).

29sad,sad,"Hi, this is my first post here, and I'm pretty sure it's a long one. 

I'm 23 years old, I only have an older brother, who is a NEET, so all the respobilities is all on me. I'm the only one who is working, my dad is with another family. He sometimes visits us. My mom is living with my Grandmother and my Uncle. So basically, me and my brother are the only ones here in the house (w/c we only rent)

Here in our house, we have a barber shop and a small store. But ever since the pandemic, it got tough. Not a lot of customers coming to our shop/store. I always think how to pay the bills (rent, water, electricity, internet). Please keep in mind that my salary from working in a company is completely inadequate for the rent alone. 

I always lock myself in my own room, since I don't want to interact with my brother, since he's the type of guy who brags all the time without having any achievements (e.g. studied until high school only, no work, etc.)

I work as an assistant in a financing corporation.  I always do my best effort in interacting with clients, with coworkers. However, I always get scolded from other groups, telling me that I'm not doing my job right. There was one time that I literally cried for an hour in the restroom cubicle, because one of my coworker says that I always make the same mistakes. She always scolds me, only noticing the mistakes I made. She never notices the good things I did. 

In work, I never got the chance to know if I did a job well done, I always hear from my work that I always make mistakes. 

This week, I didn't get to report to my work. I have this feeling that I don't want to work, because I will interact with some coworkers, only getting bad vibes from them. At the same time, feeling sad because I can't get to help my other coworkers, making them to work double as to cover my absence. 

It also came to me if I should look for a new job, because the work I have now is pretty much not doing the best for me, especially my self esteem. Also, thinking if I quit, how can I pay the bills here in our house. I did thought of what if, I try to end my life. Thinking of it, I also think of the people who will be left, so it stops me from commiting it. 

Being alone here in my room makes me think a lot of things, I also cried while typing this post. Not sure if I need help, or am I just thinking things. 

I actually asked my friend if he thinks I have a mental illness or not, he told me that I'm just overthinking it and cheers me up that I can overcome this.

I looked into my water cup to find it a milky white and this send me swiftly moving to the kitchen sink to rinse it out. I noticed a white residue in the bottom, one that I swiftly washed away. Ever since then I've been afraid that what i'm consuming is somehow contaminated, mostly water I drink. Today was especially hard because even though it didn't look any different I felt like my water was somehow wrong and not the same. I couldn't pinpoint what I derived this from but I felt it in my core like it was a survival instinct. I felt like I couldn't tell my parents, however and I didn't know why but, yet again, I just felt it intensely in my being. I haven't drank water all day and i'm now afraid to take my medication in fear that it is also contaminated with something. All I can think of in my head is a white mucus or film and pale white hands brushing against me, whispering to me in languages unknown to any mortal being but in a way that I know i understand deep down somewhere. I don't know, i'm just confused right now. Physically I feel fine but mentally I feel like i'm being watched and assessed and that if i fall asleep I won't wake up.  I feel like I can't tell if noises are laughter or crying and it scares the heck out of me and I want to understand whatever is there reaching for me with its dozens of clammy hands and mouths. I don't know, I just need to get this out there. I have a past with psychotic symptoms and anxiety and depression and such things have lead me to the hospital twice and I don't want to go back because i just can't relive things i've seen and heard there without having another dance with trauma.

31sad,sad,"Every time I start dating someone and I become emotionally invested and attached, I get very anxious and panic. Thoughts of infidelity and not being good enough flood my mind. If he's taking a while to respond to me, I'll panic and think he's talking to some other girl or he doesn't want to talk to me. In the beginning it's usually manageable and I can talk it out with my partner but it gets worse and worse as time moves on. I don't know why these thoughts fester my mind. They haven't done anything, that I know of, that has given me a reason to doubt them. There's this part of me that wants to be the best of the best in their eyes: better than all their exes and previous partners. This includes personality, physical attractiveness, career, etc. The physical attractiveness is usually the one I'm most concerned about. I have some assumptions as to why I feel this way. I am riddled with negative thoughts about my appearance. I don't like how I look and don't really consider my self an attractive person. That's (my face) not something I can change about myself. There's this constant thought of not being enough for them and because of that maybe they'll stray because I'm not enough for them to stay. Maybe if I'm the best, they'll actually try to keep me… I know no one's perfect and it's not exactly possible to be the best at everything… but I can't seem to get those thoughts out of my mind. Usually at the 2-3 month mark, it gets so bad to the point where I panic because I don't think they're interested in me as much anymore or I'll nitpick at the things they say about me and make it out to be an attack on my appearance or just me in general. I'll end this out of nowhere and without hesitation because I just want to stop feeling that way…. and maybe they'll step forward and show me that they actually want me. This time around, I notice that my hand tremors have gotten more noticeable. I should've caught on that I'm more anxious than normal instead of dismissing it. When they don't step up and “let things end”, I feel personally attacked and go into a spiral. I make myself the victim of the narrative because them just agreeing to me being “too sensitive for the relationship” or any other lame excuse I give, means that they personally think that way and that I'm too much for them to handle… I'm unwanted again… 

I have been cheated on and sexually assaulted in the past and that has a big influence on how I act now but I don't know how to through this cycle of anxiety and panic…",-1,-15.97835498,-2.532467532,-9.300865801,-4.285714286
32sad,sad,"I (17F) have been living with a family friend(FF) and my mother for about 2 years now. Only recently, since quarantine started, have I become so uncomfortable with her I can barely handle being in the same room as her. 

She thinks I'm really irresponsible because I don't do my chores, but in reality I can't bring myself to do them when she's around. I got the vibe that she already dislikes me, which caused me to distance myself and not talk as much.
Pretty sure this has caused FF to dislike me even more till the point where she sometimes just glares at me.

This led to me becoming more and more uncomfortable around her to the point where I will only go downstairs to eat when she's not around and that I am now too uncomfortable to even go downstairs to leave the house. I know that when I go downstairs and she's there, I have to say something, but firstly I have no idea what to say to her and secondly I feel like whatever I say she's going to snap at me. Usually I end up just chickening out whenever I have to be in her presence and keep quiet, hoping she doesnt say anything to me as I dash past her. 

I've talked to my mother about this and she just says ""just get over it, you have to get over it"", but I don't know how. Can someone give me some advice on how I can handle this situation?

Events that led up to the point: 

An extremely stressful morning of package handling (a package being signed and delivered to someone who was not me, and only half of another package coming in). The morning was full of stress and tears. 

After a couple hours of sleep my partner and I were having a discussion about why things were happening, and some comments were said that caused me to run away from the conversation very distraught and crying. (I have a history of self harm and two suicide attempts very recently). 

I was about to cut myself when my partner stopped me and hugged me, apologizing and talking to me. During the time my partner was talking to me I completely couldn't move. It felt like I wasn't even there in the room. I could feel myself semi present in my mind, but not in my body. I've never experienced this before and I didn't know what to do. I was still crying the whole time but not functioning any other way except for blinking. 

When I finally did come back I was very scared and backed away from my partner. I was trying to back away from the situation because of how scared and confused I was. After coming back I cried very hard and was shaking quite a lot in my legs.

I'm anxious constantly. The pain from my trauma affects me every day. I live in emotional agony. 
I've been trying to get on SSI for a year now and I have no other income. I've tried to work but I sincerely just can't do it. Even 9 hours a week total was seriously pushing it for me. And that's not enough to live off of on minimum wage. But I can't survive without money.
I feel so alone and alienated. I don't understand people. I don't understand why money keeps me and so many other people like me from the basic things we need. Housing, food, water, clothing. It's kept from us unless we can pay and keep the pockets of some rich bastard fat and happy.

I can't survive in this world. I don't think I was meant to. I don't want to go to the hospital or the doctor anymore. I used to, but for what? So they can give me a pill and tell me to find a way to cope with the feelings that are left? Ignoring the material issues. Such as how I can't survive without money. I am tired of struggling to recover, only to be hit with a new blow and falling down all over again. I'm really tired of it. I don't see a point, because this is going to be how the rest of my life is. Struggling to get by for another day, another week, another month, another year. Struggling to survive but never living. That's how my life has always been and whenever I have tried to change it or to end this cycle, it gets worse.

I moved in with some long time friends across the country and instead of finding stability like they'd said I learned one of them is an offending pedophile and the other is an emotionally abusive stalker. I came back to my hometown and was only able to afford it from the stimulus check and selling a lot of my stuff. I was stuck there for 8 months total and spent the last half of them in constant terror, genuinely fearing for my life.

I don't have family that support me. I'm trans and gay, and I ran away from an abusive home when I was 19. Even if I tried to come back to them to beg for help my life would get worse.

I had been planning for half a year now to move into public housing with my partner. Because that's been my dream. To make a family, have that sort of stability and belonging that I've never had. The application came in the mail. My partners abusive grandmother had previously said she would pay for his plane ticket here, and reimburse him for some other things. Since the application came in she's been flip flopping on paying it and now yesterday she's decided that instead of paying to get him to move here, she'll pay his way through college, something he had never expressed interest in. He's in the same boat as me, wanting to try to get on SSI. I've seen him struggle with working. I've seen him struggle just in general. 

She isn't offering this out of kindness or a desire to educate him, she's doing it for the same reason she's been flip flopping. I know exactly how she is. Both of us do but he's just... Accepting it and I don't understand. She wants to keep him under her control. That's all it is. If she was genuinely interested in furthering his education, and he was genuinely interested in pursuing it, there's no reason he wouldn't be able to go to college here, in a college town, in a state much better and a town much better than where he is. He'd be locked there for at least four years. But he said he kind of wants to do it, and that it doesn't matter if she backs down. This doesn't make any sense to me anymore. Nothing does. But why should I be surprised anymore, because this is always how shit goes for me. I have been trying so hard to get his paperwork settled and to save up money for him to come since she refused to pay, we have been planning this for half a year. And now it's just not happening.

It started when I was talking to this dude- on of the first guys if not the first that I've ever romantically talked to (I'm closeted). Things were wonderful and we had such good relationship by my situation and distance made us end it.

Then multiple times they expressed continued sexual interest me. They don't express interest in a relationship, just sexual. It hurt. It hurts. I'm seeing them next week with friends. Idk how to navigate it.

It's not just this dude. It's a lot of stuff. I never thought of myself as attractive until I got to university and started getting catcalled and got stalked around a gym. I don't like feeling this way especially when I don't see myself this way because of my body dysmorphia.

57sad,sad,"Just to preface, before I began experiencing these feelings, I was always someone into philosophy. I knew there were many philosophers who discussed some dark stuff, but I paid little attention. However, in the past 4 months I've fallen into this rabbit hole of philosophical pessimism, anti-natalism, misanthropy, and pro-extinction movements. After reading this stuff my world view suffered dramatically.

Every day I feel anxious and angry that I am alive. I keep having dark thoughts that my sentience is a burden and my parents were cruel and selfish for having me. Just the other day I saw some children playing outside with their parents. Something as innocent as that to me felt evil because their parents subjected their children to unimaginable amounts of pain and suffering without their consent. I felt the best thing to do was to hope the family had a quick and painless death all at once to spare them from suffering. After that, I felt my chest tighten and my feet went cold. That feeling has been periodically coming and going the past week.

When I write that this is a feedback loop, I mean it in the sense that I feel a strong compulsion to keep reading these ideas even though I am aware of how much pain they're causing me. I canceled plans because I was reading Ligotti's ""Conspiracy Against the Human Race"" which put me into a state was almost like a breakdown but not quite; yet I couldn't stop reading.

The psychosis side of things has calmed down quite significantly due to medication but my depression and anxiety flare up all the time.

On Monday I had a bad flare up with my depression. I'd been alone for the majority of the day (live with mum and brother) and I was bored, like to the point it was really getting me down, sounds stupid I know.. like why not just do something? Well there was nothing to do, I don't have friends, my boyfriend was out with his friends and I had no motivation to do anything anyway, that's when the bad thoughts started creeping in.

So it got to about 7pm and at this point I'd had enough of being on my own, feeling worthless, nobody to talk to and the thing that overtook my thoughts the most was to take an OD. I've had this thought many many times before but I've never acted on it but that night I was soo close. I started crying uncontrollably and couldn't think of anything else apart from to hurt myself, so started punching myself in the head. Better than killing myself right? (It's Wednesday now and my head still hurts from the blows). I also downed a fair bit of vodka at this point too.

My boyfriend came over that night and soothed me until I fell asleep. 

Yesterday we went out for the day and I had so much fun, we went to a local pet store just to look at the animals and my mind felt so clear for the first time in a long time. 

I can't help thinking about Mondays events though and it makes me feel bad again, I haven't told my mum about it all because I don't want to upset or anger her.

I am sorry for all negativity as described below. There are also a lot of beautiful moments in our household, but in this post I am mainly venting and describing the negative aspects.

My boyfriend and I want to move out into an apartment for ourselves. We live in a dysfunctional household with my brothers and one parent. We have been actively searching for a place for the last 7 months, but it's extremely hard to find a place as a starter without paying a ridiculously amount of money. We've been to two house viewings but every time we're the third or fifth in line or so. Finding a new place is definitely getting closer, and I know we will find a nice home eventually, but I feel like it is taking too long.  I feel like I am utterly powerless. We apply for like 20 places every week and it is exhausting. I frustrate myself daily about all horrible aspects of our household: the mess everywhere,  no one cleans their own shit, my brothers who live completely in their own word (severe mental health problems), my father who wants to move on with his life and  girlfriend but cannot do that due to many reasons.. the atmosphere is often terrible and I wouldn't even call it a ‘household'.

I love my family and if I could I would fix their problems, but unfortunately I cannot. I have enough things I'm struggling with myself. I just want to move on with my lovely boyfriend and keep a greater distance to everyone else's shit and depressing moods. I've had various breakdowns the last few months (especially due to quarantaine). I know once I move it I am never moving in again in the house I grew up in. So I try to make the most of the time left living in this house. I am  sure the connection between me and my brothers/father will become better once we have our own place.

So I (20F) have this weird i guess habit, I'm not sure what to call it, where if thoughts about something I regret or feel guilty about in the past memories start playing then the only way to stop them is by saying out loud “I want to kill myself” to stop them. To be clear I don want to harm myself currently but I did at some point in my life. Lucky I got myself out of that darkness but I have this now weird habit. The images of the regrettable memory or traumatic memory literally don't stop and just grow with negative emotion unless I say that phase. Idk what it is much less explain it without sounding weird. I want to definitely explain it to some one professionally but I'm terrified they'll say that I do want to somehow harm myself and that's not the case.

78sad,sad,"Hi redditors,

I (f 30) feel like I'm losing my sanity in my current relationship with my bf (28) of a little over 2 years.

I am highly emotional and he has depression and, I and his brother suspect, some narcissistic tendencies. We moved in together last fall and all hell broke lose. We both had trouble adjusting and all expectations fell short. I ended up going to therapy because I felt my emotions were the root of all trouble and I discovered a lot about myself and about how to control my emotions, although of course it's a work in progress. 

I have since started journaling to further explore where emotional overreactions may stem from and what situations trigger me. I feel much more balanced and more often than not am able to put negative mindsets aside in order to focus on healing and passion in my life. 

My bf struggles very hard to recognize the progress I am making and is extremely sensitive  - understandably - to situations that have led me to ""explode"" in the past. In his eyes, I'm a monster who's responsible for ruining his life, he starts attacking me as a ""prevantative measure"" and claims he ""was right about my all along"" should I react poorly to him calling me names, telling me I was retarded and didn't deserve to be loved etc. 

Since Corona started he has been admittedly extra sensitive due to the restrictions, but he still claims every little spat is my fault, interpretes everything I do as an attack on him and tells me I deserve to be treated this way for being such a horrible human being. Anything nice I do for him, any affection I show him becomes worthless in his eyes, because eventually we will start fighting again, which makes me ""a liar for being nice to him even though I visciously wanted to make his life miserable"".

Lately I'm noticing some aggression from my side towards him when he attacks me for having feelings and belitteling me. He doesn't recognize that his behaviour is part of this vicious cycle where we emotionally abuse each other and every day it's getting more difficult to detach myself from these feelings of aggression. Today I even slapped him after he called me a name, and even though we had a calm conversation after and I know both sides were extremely aggressive, I feel horrible for not being able to control myself.

My ressources for stabilizing my mental health seem to be failing at the moment and I wonder if anybody might share some wisdom from similar experiences?

I am really struggling to carry this relationship on my shoulders, but I still feel like I'm very far from being able to end it. I'd appreciate any thoughts or ressources that could help me gain balance, perspective and emotional strength to not engage in this toxic cycle.

I spend days crying over the fact that I'm living in this crappy house. My husband is fine with the house, he isn't bothered by the problems. 

I also have a little bit of a hoarding problem, as I am way too emotionally attached to objects. It's not full on hoarding, my house isn't falling on top of me, I just have a fair bit of clutter and boxes of stuff stored in the loft. I'm working on getting rid of it but when I'm depressed I flick between wanting to keep everything and wanting to throw it all in a skip. 

Anyone else go through anything similar? Any advice?",-1,-11.24444444,-15.83333333,-27.24444444,-8.5
81sad,sad,"It sound weird, but it just occurred to me last night that for the whole of this very stressful year, I haven't pulled the duvet over me, plumped my pillows or hell, even properly made my bed (I've changed it, I just haven't put much effort into making it a comfortable place to rest). And this got me thinking about how I've been approaching this year in general.

It's been a tough year both worldly and personally and I have been making very solid attempts at being more happy with myself and moving up in life. I've been going through each day like it's simply just a stepping stone onto the next, and I haven't made attempts to make myself comfortable in the moment. Sleeping isn't a time to relax anymore, it's a process I need to get through in order to reach tomorrow. 

I feel like I can't experience comfort as the things which used to give my head comfort now just give me stress and what will perhaps give me peace of mind in the future, I currently don't posses.

So I don't know. I don't miss what used to give me peace of mind as it was ultimately negative, but now I'm left in a strange transition spot in my life and I'm just jumping from one day to the next. Sorry if this 
was too in cohesive to follow or if it seems arbitrary.

82sad,sad,"I find it hard to switch myself out of certain moods, specifically negative ones.

For example, my brother was late to dinner with my family tonight. This slightly upset my mother, which in turn greatly upset me. My mom was able to drop it but I wasn't, even though I tried.

I spent the rest of the night upset and was not talkative, it made the dinner less pleasant than it could've been and I might as well not have even been there. I feel bad but it's almost that my emotions are out of control.

This is one example but this always happens, once I start feeling upset or negative it seems like the thoughts are a one-way train with no breaks. I tried to excuse myself, take some deep breaths and I recognized that I don't need to feel this way and my emotions are a choice, but it didn't change my mood, it never does.

I don't like this, I don't like feeling negative, how can I get myself to “snap out” of a funk like this when I enter one?",-1,-9.958333333,-10.83333333,0,-9.375

84sad,sad,"I've always doubted myself and relied on my friends/SO's to help me through my tough times. I developed this habit through my parents divorce 4-6 years ago (it took 2 years for the whole process). With quarantine and not being around my friends and being home from university, I haven't talked to my friends from school all that much. My friends from high school are here, but I wasn't (and still not) close enough to talk about my issues with them. I never really was in with the group, so I relied on my SO's.

My SO broke up with me about 2 weeks ago, and I just feel so empty now. I still talk to them everyday because they said they'd would still want to be friends (they weren't in the right mental space, and I was too dependent) and I'd rather not lose my best friend as well as my SO. So I've been trying to not talk about my problems, and without them or being around my friends from school, I just feel so alone. I have a full time job over the summer, but it's WFH and I'm alone the entire workday, and then I usually just stay in my room the rest of the day. 

Although they said I can always come to them if I need help, I'm not going to burden my ex like that. I still love them so much, and I'd never want to hurt them by adding to their problems. This makes me feel stuck because I feel like I don't have anyone to talk about my problems with. I won't tell my parents about my problems because my sister has some mental health problems, and they're worried about her, and I don't want my parents to be worried about me.

All of this loneliness combined with the person I love not even having feelings (they're trying to suppress their feelings until they're gone, and they already are/almost gone) makes me feel empty. I feel like I never win in life. I always lose. I thought about killing myself about 5 (ish?) years ago: I laid on my side in the bath tub and said whichever side I fall on is what happens. Now, I know I can't kill my self. It's selfish, rude, un-empathetic, I'm too much of a coward to do it, and it'd crush my sister, parents, and my ex. I'm also scared to die, there's too much that's unknown and I hate not knowing things.

I've scheduled an appointment with a therapist, but it's in a week, and I want to improve myself because I very well know that I need to. I just really don't want to be here right now. I want to just vanish in a Thanos snap, and then come back when everything is better. I'm sorry for the rant, it was probably a waste of your time to read it.

During a well-check at the doctors is there any paper or something I can write on so my mom dosent see and the doctor can just make an assessment so my mom doesn't get mad and know I wrote anything? Is there any sort of form just for the child? I know my mom won't actually get mad but she'll say I lied and just want attention and am a hypochondriac. I just want some way to talk to her or something without getting in trouble. Please give me some advice.

And please don't misunderstand my mom is great and treats me well and feeds me and stuff but she is turning into a boomer about mental health because “it's just a trend and nobody has actual depression or anxiety. All these teens are just trying to be trendy. When I was a kid no one heard of mental health issues.” ..ya because you all lived in a world without anything to worry about.

89sad,sad,"

Today was mentally the hardest days ive gone through. Ever. Nothing particularly bad happened. I was just lost in my mind. I just worked at a job i hate. Ive been recently having thoughts like ""what am i living for? I have no purpose and no one needs me."" and today those kind of thoughts were overwhelming. I was very short tempered , i didnt care. Before i left work i just left it a mess and clocked out. This was obviously careless and now with a clear head i feel bad for leaving like that. I just wanted to go home and hide under the blankets. Living feels like a chore to me. I recently lost both of my dogs due to my living situation. For a long time i would tell myself i live for them. Because they needed me. Something needed me. I loved them so much. I dont really have friends, i have a roommate whos really important to me but hes out of town a lot and i dont want to stress him . So when hes out of town, i seem to explode. and i dont like burdening my family especially when ive been told my mental problems aren't that bad. Im aware that im not homeless or starving but everyday still hurts inside my head. I always leave it inside, my feelings, because i dont see them as important anymore. 

When i got home i just laid in bed and sobbed quietly. I cant even describe the feeling. I just shut down after a bit. Laying there lifelessly. Then i had the urge to get into the bathtub. With my clothes on and warm warm water. It felt nice. I felt so cold and then so warm. I was in a trance, and these thoughts did not stop. I kept thinking about how tired i was and how i had no one to call , no one to turn to. Ive had several friends leave me because im too much for them. Another reason why I hold everything in. Venting made me lose important people. While in the tub i thought of those no longer in my life. I thought about what our last memory would be together. I wondered if theyd care if i turned up dead. I let the water go over my face and in a weird way, i felt at peace. I stayed under for a bit, the water spilled over and i didnt care. 

I then remembered that i had called my dad earlier that day, and that he might come over. I immediately sat up and started crying uncontrollably over the thought of my dad finding my body there. I remember not calling my mom for help because she was mad at me. I had to remember that even if i felt alone, my parents do love me unconditionally. In a way my dad pulled me out of that trance. I remembered my roommate too, how he'd have to deal with that. I felt so weird and i couldnt stop crying. 

I eventually got out of the tub, changed into dry clothes. I didnt feel that much better though. My roommate called to see how i was doing. One thing i love about him is how he checks up on me. I didnt tell him everything often but i did talk to him. He listened and let me cry a little and talked to me the best he could. I know its hard for people, and him, to give advice on touchy subjects like that but what matters most to me is that he was there and he tried. He was busy but called me a few times throughout the day to make sure i was okay. 

I also went to my mom's. Made a few comments that raised concern and made my mom cry. I didnt mean to, i usually stay quiet about these things because my mom tends to blame herself and i dont want her to do that. I don't want to be the cause of her unhappiness just because im unhappy. I know she loves me, i know my dad loves me, i know my roommate cares about me. Eveb if its just three people , thats okay right? That's enough. Im just so scared of being alone. I dont know where i was going with this post. I originally wanted to know why i did what i did. Why did i want to be in the tub? I wasnt intentionally thinking about suicide , but like i said-- i went into this like trance i just didnt care and i wanted it to stop. I don't think i wanted to kill myself, but that felt close, the closest ive ever been and im so scared of myself. 

I just don't know what to do now. I feel better- not cured but okay. I feel okay. Im proud of myself for making it through today. Im here and i did it. 

Comments, questions, resources and advice are all welcome. Again i think i wanted to vent or just tell my story. Maybe understand why i had that urge to be underwater. I don't know. ",-1,-2.956842105,-4.134035088,-8.303157895,-1.884210526

92sad,sad,"I don't have a single happy memory from when i was younger apart from a ""clip"" of me playing in the snow when i was 4 years old. every memory after that up until i was 8 years old is just filled with abuse and violence from my mother.

Things didn't improve much when i lived with my father, he frequently left me to fend for myself so he could either sell drugs or have sex with women. I practically raised myself until i was 11. At this point my mother coaxed me into returning to her and my little half-sister, under the guise that she had changed and was no longer an abusive person. Obviously that was a lie, and within 2 weeks of being back the abuse started. I was cooking and cleaning, getting my little sister ready for primary school. Hell the only thing she did was sleep on the couch.  I had my friends around a lot and in the end she accused them of molesting my little sister. I still believe to this day that she did that because she wanted to sleep from 4pm-6pm and the noise we made stopped that from happening.

Eventually my aunt got involved and told me to live with her and i did. Although once i lived with her it was great, holidays every year and just a nice household. About 2 years in my mother threw accusations that i tried to kill my sister and that i molested her. My entire family got involved and it turned out that my sisters father was a convicted pedophile and put a knife to my mothers throat back in the day. So it transcribed that she was just throwing the same experiences about to effectively bend the truth to whatever situation she could. My entire family black-sheeped her and she was literally forgotten about.

Now although no one believed her, my mental health has just been destroyed, my confidence with dealing with children has really messed up to the point where i feel like can't interact with them because in the back of my mind i think people think i'm a pedophile when i'm most definitely not. This has caused a rift between my godson and my little 2nd cousins which i regard as my nephews. Although i want to be stupid, silly and all loving but this mental wall is just stopping me from doing this. In fact, i find it very difficult to love anyone, it's like i lack the functionality feel that emotion at all.

My sister has tried to contact me on multiple occasions but since she still regularly speaks to my mother, even though shes been sectioned on more than one occasion, i don't trust her or what she has been manipulated to believe by my mother. My family have expressed concerns about her intentions and strongly believe i should not interact with her at all, although one day if i have children i would love her to be an auntie to them, so long as my mother is kept far away and even in the dark.

I think I've rambled on a lot and need to ask the question, can you ever mentally heal from a complete lack of love? has this forever messed me up and i'm never going to be happy or even be able to fully love another human being? People will say get help, but then i'll need a therapist and opening up about this to other people, in real life is scary. Another aspect its almost like i'm like my mother if i have server mental health issues and i never want to be like her. Also I've never opened up to my family about how i feel every single day and i don't want them to judge me, and think i'm a freak, like my mother.

I've been home for 2 years now, in a suburb Long Island neighborhood. Every so often I go through cycles of some kind. Basically right now, and for the past week it's like everything has vanished. I'm floating in the void inside my own head, and as I sit here I can't find the words to explain everything. I'm currently between therapists, I was receiving free therapy from my school that I just graduated from, so I have no one to go to and I can't find anyone to dump this on. The COVID situation is making my job market nonexistent. I'm applying for teacher positions, but everyday I feel like I'm going to have to wait another year and work the job I can't stand, service. That might not sound like a big deal, but I have epilepsy and i take daily medication. In a year (Feb 2021) I am taken off my parents medical insurance, so i NEED a job with medical. Since moving home my social life has taken a nose dive with all my friends moving on with their lives. I had to go back to school for a certification which was a two years program so i threw myself at it with full force (bad undergrad GPA put me immediately on academic probation) and i never bothered making new friends or trying to find a relationship, which is another can of worms. Right before COVID began I was telling myself that this year I was going to change things. I wanted to change, find new people, a partner, a new life I could make my own. The teacher job market looked promising, my grades were stellar, I had lost a great amount of weight and was feeling amazing. Now everything feels like its fallen apart. I can't stand another year at home, I feel stuck here and unable to change. I cant justify moving because I only have like $25,000 saved up and it just doesn't feel like enough to try and start a life with. Even as I write this I feel like I'm complaining about nothing, everyone as issues, I'm no different. I'm struggling to even post this because other people could use the attention and I can just figure this out myself. But when I look in the mirror I just see disappointment. I feel lost and scared and angry and hope feels like its slipping away every day. I just want to break everything and lay in the wreckage, but I know that isn't the way. I dont want pity and at the same time I just want someone to sit down with and tell me it's okay and the fear and anxiety and self loathing is only temporary. I want direction, but at the same time I want to find the path myself. I want to hit something and defend myself, but I also just want to world to cave in and end this horrible feeling I feel in my head and chest. I feel like I've hit a dead end and I can scale the wall to freedom or accept it's over. But it's not over, my life has only begun.

I just wanted to have a quick rant about the thoughts I've been having lately.

I've been having a really rough week, like really rough. And basically I feel so damm lonely! I'm lonely yet I have a family and a friend, and a boyfriend.

My boyfriend is really understanding and he's been great. I lived with him last year and it was lovely and when I had a bad time there he'd always be so good at helping me lift out of it. Yet now I'm at home and because of covid I don't see him often at all. And it's been like a punch in the stomach.

A punch in the stomach at the realisation that my family are there for me but they don't understand my pain. My boyfriend does to an extent but I can't keep calling him so upset and then ruining his mood and his day and not to mention that he now feels he can't share his hurt with me.

Even when I speak to people there's nothing they can do is there. Let's be real, this is all in my own head and I don't know why it's took so long to realise but omg I have to deal with this all by myself. Noone else can make the anxiety go away, no matter how many nice things they say or how calm they try and make me.

Noone can put my life back together for me and it sucks. It sucks that I'm battling this horrible illness, or these illnesses and appart from the times of happiness with others, when I'm in pain then it's all down to me.

This makes me so angry at my mind, at my life and at everything in general to be honest. It's not fair. I didn't do anything wrong.

But I have no plans of killing myself as of right now, I just need some words of encouragement so that I don't go any lower. 

To start off, I have anxiety and depression and have been diagnosed for about 4 months. I started taking Abilify about a month ago, and the first week of 2 mg I felt great, and then it stopped working after a week. The doctor increased to 5 mg, which worked great again but now I can feel the same thing happening and just not working anymore. 

I am currently a pharmacy student and on rotations for 3 weeks. For those who don't know, basically we go to a pharmacy in different settings, hospital for me, and just shadow, learn the job, stuff like that. I'm about halfway into it and I just don't want to do it anymore. This, school, just everything. I made so many mistakes that are probably no big deal but anxiety makes it so much worse. Pharmacists are the last check before a medication goes out to a patient. With anxiety, I doubt my decisions every time and just paranoid that I did something wrong. I don't know what I want to do when I graduate and I have a really bad knee and ankle from a sprain few years ago so I don't know how long my body will hold out in retail (that's where I work at now). 

I don't have my psychiatrist appointment until next week, my counseling appointment isn't until Friday  (and he's pretty bad about checking and responding to emails so I don't want to bother him) and I don't want to bother my friend with my problems. I thought about suicide hotline but honestly I didn't find it very personable. I need some support to get the courage to get through...this thought? Day? rest of the week?

103sad,sad,"Hey,

I spoke with another person on this subject and they were the one who is making me decide that I need to do this.

My anxiety used to just be worries about death, but it's progressed more and more. It's anxiety now. Sometimes I'm just chilling and then it's like ""oh s#$t!"" and I feel a wave of anxiety. Then other times, I just feel extremely uneasy and start yawning and shaking. At that point, all I can think about is either death or I can try to redirect my mind to something else, but it never fully goes away because at that state I'm relating everything towards that.

 I need to go and talk to a therapist but my family is religious so I'm not sure how I'm going to do that.

Can anyone help me?",-3,-9.75,-2.5,-23.21428571,-10.17857143

107sad,sad,"So this may be long and drawn out, but it is simply because I don't actually know what is wrong with me or if anything is wrong at all, I'm going to be 100% honest and transparent and welcome any input whatsoever. 

\- I have a **stutter/ stammer** and have done since as long as I can remember. It's not severe but I feel it hold me back massively in all avenues of my life (Socially, dating, professional). Recently I've developed massive **anxiety** because of it; I overthink simple social gatherings with friends I've known for a long time, I am absolutely petrified of going on dates with girls and struggle with things that could possibly get me further in life.

\- I can't **concentrate** on things for a long time unless it's Netflix, Youtube, Instagram etc. I try to limit how much time I spend on these platforms as It's in the consciousness of society now that consuming too much of these things is obviously bad for you. But I used to be so ambitious and determined to put in the work that would make my life better but I find myself just wasting time and procrastinating on things so much.

\- My **discipline** has dwindled. This may link in to the previous paragraph but I've noticed I just have no discipline anymore. I never go to bed on time as my free time is very limited but it bites me in the ass the next day as I'm exhausted and work 12 hour days at work. I never sit down and do anything productive anymore as I find it mind-numbingly boring.

\- I've recently feel like I have had an **existential crisis.** My 27th birthday is 3 weeks away and I'm petrified of it as I work a mediocre job that is going no where even though I have so many things I want to do and accomplish in my life but I feel I am held back by the above. I don't know what my purpose is anymore. I used to want to be rich and constantly thought about it all the time but now I feel like it's an impossible thing to achieve with such a low rate of success and, again, the above holds me back somewhat.

\- This may not be relevant or could be extremely relevant but I also **drink and take drugs**. I feel it's necessary to mention this for obvious reasons. I would say I drink every week, some nights it's literally a beer after work at home, sometimes I do go out with friends and I end up drinking a lot and taking cocaine with my friends, not a huge amount (half a gram max) and I do it maybe once every 2 weeks - a month. I find coke makes me depressed the next day (common) as well. I know it's easy to say ""say no"" or ""you're hanging out with the wrong people"" but I've reluctantly been taking it semi-regularly for around 5 years now and when you're drunk it is so hard to say no, it's like my body sniffs the line for me without me being able to control it and after wards I'm left to think about the ""decision"" I've made, furthermore due to my stutter I don't feel like i can go out and just make new friends easily. I mentioned this in case anyone else has had a similar experience with long term drug use and can offer advice on this.

108sad,sad,"I have grown up as the only child in a toxic household. My dad is an alcoholic, and my mother didn't really do anything about it, and generally just disregarded the seriousness of the issue. But overall is a good mother.

My dad drank every night, more or less, with 3/4 nights going out to drink. From the ages of 11-16 I would stay up late to make sure when he came home there was no arguing. My school work suffered, I never had enough sleep, and this is where my anxiety stems from.There were nights where my parents would argue, he was never physically abuse but has broken items in the house. Definitley emotionally abusive. I don't know if I am ready to write about specific events. 

By the age of 14 I could not eat the days I knew he was going out, I would throw up if I heard them raise their voices, and I strarted self harming. I have had this anxiety feeling since, I went to the doctors around this time and was told ""it would pass"". I felt sick every single morning, physically sick say 30% of mornings. School didn't take it seriously even though I went to the doctors a lot. My mother only half took it seriously. I had to have my own room for my GCSE exams, my invigilator opened a can on coke and the sound it made just made me panic, mid exam. 

My dad bought his own house around the time I was 16 and started to stay there if he went out, which wasn't as often as before. Whilst I would still worry, I knew I don't have to stay up to make sure he comes in and doesn't argue. This was also the age I began drinking with friends, and had fun for the most part.

I moved out at 19 for university and loved having my own safe space, and enjoyed drinking at the start. I started taking antidepressants before my second year of university. I now have a month left at my student house before I have to move back with my parents, and have finished university.

For the past year I have found I can't handle alcohol, I will drink some, but I can't enjoy myself like I used to, and I feel this has been a long time coming. I have drunk less and less on nights out and try to leave early, or if I can not go out at all. 

I have been worried about my parents since the beginning of lockdown, if my dad would drink, would they argue? Would I be able to go and resolve it? Would I finally resort to calling the police? What would the aftermath of that be like? 

And now last night my housemate had two friends down, so them three and me and my boyfriend joined in. They played drinking games and I drank when I found it physically hard to. I was worried about being a miserable person in general and ruining the fun but I really did try. It got too much in the end and they were shouting and creating a lot of banging. One banged on the door as I was in the toilet and it just brought back memories and I broke down. I just don't want to see alcohol anymore. 

I don't know what I want from this post, but maybe similar experiences and outcomes. Any help I can get? I don't know I just want responses I guess.",-1,-4.358870968,-2.740927419,-4.557459677,-1.875

A while ago, my doctor suggested I may have agoraphobia and he put me on zoloft. The first few weeks were great, it felt like I was finally getting better. It didn't work as well for a little bit after that, and so I asked for my mom to call in and up the dosage. It helped a little, and it eventually stopped doing anything. My doctor said I should go to therapy but it never happened. 

A few months after that initial doctor's appointment, me and my mom were fighting and she ended up calling me crazy because she 'needed to take me to the doctors for being too nervous'. And after that, I just stopped trying to reach out for help. I always think about it. And maybe she didn't mean it, maybe she said it in the heat of the moment, but it hurt me a lot. It made me feel horrible, especially with all I went through to try and get help in the first place.

My anxiety has been getting worse, I can't talk to people I'm not close to without feeling like the wind is getting knocked out of me. My presentation anxiety used to be bad, but it's gotten even worse. I can't speak in front of a group without nearly crying or having a whole panic attack. And even when it's not in front of a group, when I talk about my feelings aloud, even for a small portion of the conversation, I'll just burst out into tears and I have no idea what the hell is going on. I could feel fine in the moment but appear to be 'In a mood' and if one of my parents asks if I'm okay, I just feel like I'm going to start sobbing in front of them.

I've been having trouble taking my medicine anymore, and I've been self harming. Usually it's only a couple of times every few weeks when everything bubbles over and I want to hurt myself, but it gets even worse on my period. I'll stay in bed and hardly take care of myself and I'll just lay here and feel horrible and think about what it would be like if I could off myself. I've never made plans, but whenever I get too stressed out, I always find myself looking up painless ways to go, just incase I can't take it anymore.

It feels like everything is just a mess, and I don't know what to do. My sister used to have extreme mental health problems, but she never told our parents, and I feel like if I try to keep getting help, it'd just be really unfair. She deserved help too but she didn't get it when she needed it most and that makes me feel so fucking horrible.

I don't know what else to say honestly. If you're reading this, thank you. and I hope you have a nice rest of your day",-3,-7.981666667,-3.235,-18.08333333,-11.675

112sad,sad,"Hi everyone!

I'm over 25, suffering from agoraphobia and, things leading to another, living with my parents with no job. I'm not making much progress because I fear pain and basically have no motivation to do anything causing me pain. Finding love recently has pushed me to see a hypnotherapist and I've made baby improvements, but I unfortunately have bad reflexes of sadness, self-loathing and basically doing nothing when I'm feeling bad.

However, my parents are worried and upset and recently decided to enforce rules for me for my own good (like waking up at a certain time, doing chores, etc.)

Unfortunately, this resulted in me feeling really disappointed and angry at them. I said that I expected them to be kind and helpful instead of punishing, but they simply answered that being kind did nothing and that they're not punishing but helping. According to online ressources, taking your child's things away and giving them consequences when they act in a way you disapprove is legit education, but as someone in a child position, I find it hard to swallow, haha. I am of course aware that it is their home and that I have to submit, but I feel that trust has been broken between us.

This has at least motivated me to try and find a job (so that I can leave lol), and some of my friends are ready to motivate and help me in a positive way. I will start CBT very soon to see if the therapist can help me get any motivation.

Does anyone have tips to motivate me to work on my phobia and on my life in general? Is there an alternative I can suggest to my parents instead of them ""helping"" with childish rules?

Right after I quit my grandma got sick and I'm taking care of her everyday in the hospital back to back. Then she left us.

Then I was doing freelance work while looking for a job right before the pandemic hit, even looking for internships/ part time job. Anything but no luck at all. I went to several interviews and sent a lot of emails. 

When the pandemic hit, my freelance project went poof, I've got no any client at all. I've try to register on platform like fiverr ,workana, etc but I didn't get any reply. Now that things are slowly shifting back to “normal” where businesses slowly open up again in my country I was hopeful, yet I still got no reply no matter how many job I applied. I just need a temporary job until I can pursue my degree this September as a mature student. 

I feel like I'm doing nothing. Like I'm waiting for time to pass. I feel guilty that my boyfriend is covering up our rent and my dad still occasionally send me money because he knew I'm not surviving. I can't even get a job like as a waitress. 

I feel like I should be like getting my shit together at this age (25F). Sorry for the vent. I just feel awful and wanted to let it out. I will do my best to keep looking for job.

I've had a poor sense of self image for most of my life (history of self harm, body dysmorphia, and eating disorders). Over the past year, self esteem has been an extreme stressor because my boyfriend is dramatically skinnier than me. I love him more than anything but sometimes just looking at a picture of us next to each other sparks negative self talk. Anyways, this is just one factor that has been contributing to a perpetually low self esteem, which affects my overall mental health.

I always thought that body modifications would make me view myself better because even if I didn't see myself as beautiful, I could at least cover myself in beautiful things.

I had this account created some 6 months back but it stayed there, just like that. Idk what drove me to reddit these past few days, 6 days to be precise. Came across this sub the very first day and it intrigued me. Never thought that it's a possibility. I faced the horns of dilemma these past few days, drowning in memes and ghost stories, but this sub remained, never ready to say what I should have long ago. But now, I am here, at last.

What are abusive parents actually? I had gone through many a incidents of users facing abuse at the hands of their parents which I never thought possible for a parent. Those are only there for the movies, I thought. A broken child, growing up to be a person of its own. A true surviving story. But here I found many survivors. Am I one? After all movies are based on real lives.

Where do I begin! As far as my memory goes, my parents were very good and loving to me but I was mainly brought up by my grandma. There isn't much that I remember from that period. But I faintly remember an incident, I think it is from my 1st grade. It was the day of the parents teachers meeting along with the distribution of the report cards. I remember father had taken me to school and the teacher had spoken in lengths with him. He looked sombre once we left school school, not saying a word on the return journey but I was okay (didn't understand what results meant as such I guess). On return, I saw my father and mom getting together and speaking in hushed tones that somehow made me afraid, may be the vibes they were giving out. So remember running to my grandma. She stayed with us till her death. But going there later. So, I run into her arms afraid, almost at the verge of tears and ask her, what was wrong? She wouldn't say anything but smiled and gave me candies instead and told me while I was having them, now the thing removed from mind, that my report card was colourful! I didn't get it that time but was happy that it might be something good then. But soon, hell broke lose, as my father marched into her room and grabbing me by my arm, dragged me to my parent's room and locked the door! He then took off his belt and started hitting me with it. I don't remember the pain anymore, just remember grandma's face through the window, crying and asking him to stop. I have no memory of it from there and never asked anybody about it. Apparently I had failed my 1st grade, so my report card was marked with red.

I don't know what changed, but I became a good student from then on. Good in class and at home. Results improved, I mean I was getting almost full marks in every subject till I was in the 4th grade. Now coming to my parents, they were good all along this period! Remember occasional thrashing for my antiques, but it never bothered me that much. My father took interest in my studies and would task and test me from time to time. I never gave room for complaints.

But a thing that stood out, all through my school life, even in high school, was that it was my grandma who prepared my breakfast, my tiffin, getting me ready and everything while my parents slept. I had early morning school, starting from 7.15 in the morning. Till fourth grade my father used to drop me but then I used to take my bike and go. So when I left, it was just my grandma who would see me off. It still stayed with me and it doesn't sit well with me, idk why!

Growing up, I soon started going out on my own to the playground, parks to play with my friends after school, or be it basketball practice at school but everybody knew about the rule I had! My father returned from work (he was an engineer working for the government) at around 6-6.30 in the evening and I can't be out after that. So each day no matter where I was, I had to return home by 6. On the occasions (there were a few, growing in number as older I got) I wasn't home, I was not allowed in on return and has to wait outside the closed doors for sometimes hours (2 and half hour being the longest if I remember correctly) till someone, mostly my grandma forced my father to open the door.

Then I had the study routine, I had to sit down to study by 7 or else a round of either shouting or a few slaps here and there. And God save me if I dozed off studying! But nothing was a surprise as a cousin of mine used to get beaten up for getting 95 out of 100 cause someone got more than her ( her father is a gem, but I even feared her mother).

Time goes on and I go from class to class, year to year, more of less the same thing. But the thrashing or shouting reduced drastically again due to my grandma, who made my father understand that now I am grown up and shouldn't be treated so. Somehow it struck a chord with my father.

My mother all along was somewhat non existent, she too feared my father but he wasn't abusive towards any other person. Never drank, had no bad habits, but still he was this raging fireball towards me. My mother on the other hand never stopped him but would emotionally manipulate me, into doing what they thought best for me. (Now I come to think of it as emotional manipulation, god this subreddit helped me a lot). 

Hitting puberty is a time when there's need for guidance and being the only child had no one. I was sent to a boy's only school, a missionary one. So never came across girls much and it was discouraged even at home (though not directly). So naturally it made me nervous around girls. At this time I came across a girl in an extra class taken at our teachers house. She was beautiful and almost immediately I fell for her. But had no guts even to talk to her and moreover she was Muslim (a big no no in our family). So controlled my urges and thinking about everything, never approached her, not even a hi was exchanged! (She is a good friend of my now and I told her everything but it was too late, as she got married, but that's for another account! I even wrote a letter in blood, stupid teenager, huh!)

I did well in my 10th standard and decided to go ahead with science (my father wanted me to be an engineer, just like him!) and went ahead with it. But somehow I didn't find it interesting. I failed in a couple of subjects in the first term, but soon I put all my efforts in and recovered. But in my senior year I meet this girl and things changed!

I now had started growing a mind of my own (I know it was high time) so when I met this girl (from the neighborhood) I again fell head over heels for her but this time the only difference was, I approached her. Soon we became good friends, chatting over the new phone I got. She was a Muslim too, but this time something had changed in me and I dared. Friendship grew into something special but before it could go ahead anymore, somehow my father came to know about her! (I didn't tell my parents, or even my friends as I didn't want to end it prematurely. I wasn't prepared tbh) Anyways my father engaged me in a conversation about her. I played safe by neither accepting or denying, leaving it open to interpretation. That mad him even more mad but this time I got no thrashing but for a few days my existence was ignored! I was cool with that but what followed, I wasn't prepared for it.

I still remember quite vividly! It was a Sunday evening, winter had just set in and the air had lost its moisture but became chilly. I and my GF, were strolling around a park away from both our places ( she too hadn't told about me), when suddenly out of the blue, a car started honking just behind us. I turned to curse but only to find our car and father driving it. I was forced to get in, leaving her alone ( I won't forget that day, the look on her face, the last look I got of her) to get back home. 
I was taken back immediately and grinding began, this time both my parents! They accused her of being Muslim (as if it mattered) then going on to call her names, till being called a prostitute. I broke down at first then burst out, tearing my shirt as the buttons went flying in every direction, but at that moment a hard and tight slap rang across my face! It was my father, who hit me again after 4-5years! I couldn't take it anymore and left home. I went to the park but she was gone. Her phone has been switched off when I tried calling her. I got tensed!

For the night I went to my best friend's place and told him everything, about her to the events of that day. I asked him not tell my parents if they asked (they surely will visit, I knew). Nothing happened that day or the next. I had skipped school and contemplated my next moves. I tried calling her but again her phone was off! It frustrated me the whole day. I even thought of returning home and go to her place to sort out but I controlled that urge.

With nightfall came my father (my friend's parents had forced him into a betrayal, kid you not, it did feel like it then) and with him the news that my parents had visited my now ex-GF's house to talk her parents out of it so that their daughter doesn't meet me! Now I knew what the switched off phone meant! They knew I wouldn't budge, so they took the matter into their own hands. And everything was lost for me. 

My studies suffered, my mental health too took a toll (all this I am understanding now, at that time I was made to believe that these were side effects of puberty). I wasn't left alone, father started accompanying me to school and mother on the return. I somehow grew distant with my parents this time. 

Soon school life was over and I took tests to get into an Engineering College. (I wasn't sure then, but my parents wanted the legacy to go on). All these years my grandma was always there to support me, my only lifeline that kept me sane.

Now I got the opportunity to go away. It was back in 2006. I left my parents place and took an apartment in the city where my college was, some 150 miles from my parent's place. It was kind of a relief, I'll not lie! I started studying and enjoying my college life. Met, a girl in the 2nd year and everything was going well. But she opened me to art and performance art! I was always a movie buff but now I knew what I wanted to be and it wasn't an engineer! I would talk to my father on a daily basis almost ( understand, I didn't know anything how felt then) but somehow my father started changing. His change started soon after the GF fiasco. But still he was my father.

Now when everything is great my mother wanted to drop in and stay with me for a few months (apparently she missed me but I only missed my grandma, who blessed me when I left) and so she did but soon events take a turn for the sour as I was no longer the kid that left my home town, but somewhat of an independent thinker. Soon we started to clash and it was my turn to burst out but each time I did, she would break into tears, feigning a stroke (sometimes when things went out of hand) and we both lost mental peace. It went on like this for over an year ( she must have thought with time I would again change, but this time they were in for a surprise) but I didn't budge (I had broken up with this girl friend again because mom didn't like her and I don't know how it crept in to our relation, driving us apart) it was her this time she had to leave. And she left and never asked to return, thank god! 

By now I had stopped going to college and started studying about films and filmmaking on my own. And one day out of the blue I dropped out of engineering, pursue a career in film making. Surprisingly my father didn't say much but left it to me to decide, just stating the pros and cons. But for my mother now all hell broke loose. She tried every trick in her bag to get me back to engineering but this time I didn't budge. I sought out filmmakers and started assisting them, first as intern then gradually moving up the ranks. It was in 2010.

My father now seems more approachable than my mother, as she continues to discourage, even till today, using her emotional tactics. Father now gets pissed at her for this attitude but she still does. I would visit them on a bi-monthly visit, mainly to see my grandma, who was happy for me.

In 2017 my grandma died and every attachment I had to the place died with her. Never gone back since and never saw my mother too. But we sometimes talk on the phone. I meet my father every month and he is a totally different person now. But my mother still keeps nagging, the new one being, to get married! Which I will not in the near future.

I will be 33 this July 16th and now have a stable girlfriend of 7 years+, have a few movies behind me, mainly writing and assisting. My own documentaries, ads, short films and an IMDB page with 15 credits to my name.

Idk if I was raised by abusers, still now not able to judge them, so those who went through my lengthy piece be the judge and tell me. What happened to me?",-1,-3.121484739,-6.370718379,-2.839131014,-7.782886845

I've always until back in 2015 felt like a monster because everyone, including family, made it very obvious that I wasn't human.... and thus didn't deserve to be treated like a normal person..... I just..... was a tool, a fixture, a resource, and a verbal punching bag....

Then in 2015 I realized that even characters in shows and games that are portrayed as monsters can be loved so...... where did that leave me?

Nothing..... I guess

And....... the guy I dated before my current ex-gf kinda broke me and I..... I was truly done with dating.... and then a year later she came into my life....

She was amazing, and I......... I felt so numb for so long and then one day I just..... starting truly feeling the love I had for her.... before I felt numb but I could still tell I loved her it just..... felt extremely distant...

And then, Monday, she.... she stopped saying “I love you” back out of nowhere... she stopped calling me Babe..... and with my history of relationships I.... I started to get severe anxiety (diagnosed with situational anxiety) so yesterday (Tuesday) I asked her what was wrong and.......... and the issues boil down to that she cares about me...... that I embody everything that she could ever want in a SO....... but she can't imagine me with her when she imagines the future.......

And........ truly........ I have been in so many relationships where the person says that they don't love me....... but they just......... want to stay in that relationship?..... I..... I am ugly, there is no way around it..... so when I started I... I felt actually loved for the first time and......

And I guess I just......... don't know how to process my sadness... she just................ 

It feels that the world wants to make sure I knows i do not deserve to be loved in any way shape of form... when I'm a temp, when I'm a forced date, when I'm a crutch, when I'm a rebound, when I'm a literal joke, when I'm a expected fixture, and.... and when I even have the chance of being actually loved and cared for.... and I'm....

Whatever I am...... it's not worth of anyone.... no matter the circumstances...... and my fear of living and dying alone is something I just need to accept....... I'm........ I'm not worthy of love and that's okay....

125sad,sad,"It's so cool that after 2 years of hard work in therapy and working on myself, I've been able to develop the tools I need to navigate everyday life. I don't have anxiety anymore, I'm typically not depressed, and I'm doing such a good job navigating life. However, certain events in life set me off and I'm forced to face the reality that I do have a mental illness. 

Example: I got into an argument with my brother last weekend when I was visiting my parents. I erupted into a severe panic attack, my first one in ages, and I fell into a deep depression for days, and had an alcohol relapse. My parents had to come to my house and drag me out of bed. I was hysterical. I hadn't cleaned my house in days. I hadn't slept. Work was unbearable. I couldn't focus on basic tasks. 

I'm so proud of all of the progress I've made and that I've learned to navigate every day life and get out of bed in the morning, which is something I struggled with for such a long time. I've come such a long way and that's great, but it's so scary when one seemingly minor event reminds me that I do have anxiety and depression. What hurts is that I manage it so well that I forget I have it. That's what makes the episodes of strong uncontrollable emotion so hurtful to me. I never see it coming because I forget that part of me exists. 

Then, I inevitably have to spend a week or two focusing extra hard on mindfulness, exercise, checking in with my therapist, and managing my diet to make sure that I can recover properly. Because once I'm down, getting back up is work. I have intense flashbacks of whatever caused me stress, I don't sleep well, and I can't stop replaying the events in my head. 

Coming back is nice, but at the same time I hate the glaring reminder that navigating life is a bit tougher for me. I wish that weren't the case. My family is always very concerned for me and I never understand why. But, the more i see my pattern develop, I understand why they worry. It's because no matter how long I keep it together, they inevitably have to come scrape me off the floor at least twice a year. It sucks that I put that burden on my parents.",-1,-7.852307692,-1.153846154,-11.14461538,-5.353846154

I go by a different name. This bully's given name was the same as my preferred name. The first day of class, the teacher was reading out our names from the sheet to take attendance, and he said my given name. I politely asked him not to call me by that, and to avoid confusion with the bully, to call us by our last names or number us. He ignored my request, and said that he would just call me by my given name as it was written on the sheet. After this interaction, for reasons I do not understand, this bully would shout my given name from across the room, with no provocation, at any time when the teacher wasn't directly talking to the class. Every day. Of every week. Over. And over. And over. Again. I couldn't tell the teacher to make him stop, since his apathy was the inciting event. I was afraid to tell anyone else (counselors, parents, etc) about it, because I was afraid they would think I was overreacting. For the first few weeks, I would tell the bully to stop each time he did it. When he didn't, for the next 2 months, I tried ignoring him, just like I had been told from childhood-ignore the bully, and they will stop. He did not stop. And, for these two months, each time he did it, I could feel it striking like a chisel on my skull. Each time, my hate for him only grew. Towards the end of the two months, I would often imagine him in pain, suffering, and death, all inflicted by me, and laugh out loud at the mere thought. I truly didn't know how I could endure this for the 3 months left of the school year, and I didn't know what I would do when it became too much to bear.

I've changed medication, lost weight, changed diets, etc. the world has also been pretty wild over these past seven months. Needless to say, my mental health is considerable worse. I get randomly paranoid and obsessively, I've developed compulsive traits (both mental and psychical) and I have to be extremely careful not to see something that triggers an panic/anxiety attack. It's becoming harder and harder to socialize because any little minor thing will throw me into an anxiety spiral. Simply put: I'm exhausted. I've already had to get off social media (for the most part) because people online trigger my social phobias. I'm currently speaking to a doctor to get these issues sorted out, but in the meantime, I'm curious to know if there's anything I can do to soothe this. These issues are getting out of my control and I just want some rest. I don't need anything super in-depth or deep, I just am curious about what y'all do to cope when you're going through hard mental periods. Thank you.",-1,0.32967033,-1.423076923,-4.071428571,0

148sad,sad,"Example, being told “You're not entitled to sex” starts to feel like “You're not worthy of sex”.

Being a 24 year old virgin, it really feels like a reinforcement of “never gonna happen, unless you pay a sex worker, at least”.

And what about love? Can't buy that. What if I CAN get one, but not both together?

I've been told “You're ugly as fuck” and other similar things by so many back in grade school, and by literally hundreds online. This is what makes it really feel like confirmation that I'm unfuckable, and unlovable. 

I hear too many mixed and contradicting opinions online, like “Embrace being single and celibate”, “Just wait for it to happen one day” (waste even more youth), “Get chemically castrated or on something to kill your libido” (I can't help but feel that this might actually make me feel even worse? And it just sounds unhealthy. But if I have to be a “cuck” it'd be better if I could at least not care about it, right?), and of course “Just pay for it.”

I almost fell into inceldom, a group that claimed to be non-hateful incels (which was bs). They were just telling me to accept my fate, and making me further believe that I am somehow universally unattractive to the female race on a genetic level (that's not possible, right?)

I've been told that I'm not entitled to ANYTHING. But food, shelter, healthcare, etc. Seem to at least be debatable, since you will literally die without them. This bothers me less, since I've never had to go without any of these and had them provided to me/accessible my whole life, but I could lose all that at any time too. 

The existence of real life 30-40+ year old virgins feels like reinforcement that I'll be joining them if I've still never been able fi do it, because my life up until this point, points to their direction.

The existence of virgins losing it in their late 20s (older than me, but still in 20s) is KIND OF HOPEFUL, but that doesn't prove I'll be like them either.

Just waiting for life to happen seems like justification to not put in any effort, or maybe I'm misinterpreting that because I'm so sheltered and inexperienced at life and take things so literal.

Say I DO lose it within the next few years, or even this week (LOL, just an example, no way that'd happen, especially with the you know what virus going on), and me and her end up in a serious relationship. I don't see it lasting, because I'll constantly feel inferior (especially if she's had multiple sexual partners before me) and wander about what I missed out on, sex with multiple partners, what that variety is like, before settling with one to be seriously together with.

I honestly see myself looking up and shooting the birds (my fingers) and yelling “TAKE THAT GOD/UNIVERSE/WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU ARE! FUCK YOUR PLAN FOR ME TO BE A LONELY VIRGIN! I TOOK CONTROL AWAY FROM YOU! IT'S MY LIFE MOTHERFUCKER! GO THROW A FUCKING FIT ABOUT IT! MY FATE MY CHOICE MOTHERFUCKER!!!!” and laughing like a hysterical maniac, after losing it. 

It'd be a victory against forces higher than me. But a lot of people's contradictions about God or whatever have probably corrupted my view about God too, if there even is a God.

I know, I sound crazy. Just goes to show how ridiculous the concept of God, or the interpretation of God can be. No good God would send us to “Hell” for not believing in him without providing reason/proof to believe in Him....",-1,-7.907407407,-3.438746439,-6.766381766,-3.675213675

158sad,sad,"This is a long one.
I (17m) have been friends with a girl (Let's call her N, her username starts with an n, all letters are based off usernames,) since I was 10 years old and she was 11. I've been through a lot with her, helping each other with our depressions and encouraging each other, she was always there for me, and I felt like we would be like this forever. 

Now, N is severely mentally ill. She grew up in an abusive and neglectful home, and felt like fictitious worlds and characters were the only constant in her life. She began to have dreams of interacting with them, and felt like they were her only friends. She believes that the person she is in the dreams (A shape shifting dragon who protects characters from their creators, she made up a whole world around it) is the ""real"" her and her actual body outside the dreams is merely a shell for it. 

It's gotten to the point where she cannot watch TV or play games due to feeling too connected to their characters, and grows depressed from nobody believing her. I only know this because she knew me long enough to trust me with it, she thinks I believe it's real, and honestly, I probably deserve this for not doing more to release her from it, but seeing how she firmly believed in it and refused to listen to anyone who says otherwise, I didn't feel like I had a choice.

N does lots of online roleplaying with her characters, and always has. I used to, but later only really did it to support her. An older friend of hers (P) who she (according to P) cut off all contact with after she didn't believe her dreams were real, reached out to her, and gave her a discord invite, wanting to get back in touch with her and saying that she missed roleplaying with her. I was interested and joined too. Now there were lots of people here, but the most important I'll call K and C. K was 19 when N was 17, and right off the bat relentlessly hit on her, and made explicit comments about her to her in private messages. She put up with this because she felt flattered by the attention. C has anxiety and didn't like K. Most of us didn't, but we were too scared to say anything because of how close he was to P. 

I for one always felt incredibly anxious there, and I was in a really bad place, right off the bat K hated my guts and saw me as a rival, I hated how he would talk about N, in front of everyone no less, and, after N invited me to a new server she made for close friends, walked in on them basically being really sexual before she nuked the server and apologised to me in dms. They had a big fight and N left the server, not because of K's sexual harassment of her, (which she apparently vented about to other female users in pms, according to C) but because he insulted her characters after he figured out she thought it was real. K also exploited her longing for the lover she has in her dream worlds. K got mad at me and accused me of turning everyone against him, we fought, and P banned me. 

N started a new server for the friends she made on the old one, including C and myself, and we bonded, I really felt a deep connection to them all. P also apologised for K's actions and started a new roleplay server. 

Now, it's a bit of an open secret that N is mentally ill. She takes the roleplay super seriously, and gets upset when people don't like her characters. And so, everyone else's characters practically worshipped the character that was meant to be her, and it got annoying to me after a while. C felt the same way, so we talked in pms. I'm an absolute asshole for doing this, but we complained about N a lot. Turns out she led C to a mental breakdown over her getting tired of playing a character she liked, but C never told anyone. So N never knew. We complained about how her characters could do no wrong, how I felt like she didn't care about me anymore, and all the times C felt like she was pressuring her to always be online and hold up to her expectations. Sometimes I felt like we were going too far, but kept it to myself for the most part. 

I felt bad for C, so I talked to N about it in pms. She got super depressed and scared that the others were scared of her, and were gonna leave her. I did my best to help her. Later in a voice chat C's stream cut out and N said things like: ""Hey C!"" ""You there?"" ""Miss you!"" In text. I was worried C might take that the wrong way, so I told her to please stop. She was silent for a while, then left. I told the others I was worried about N. 

Seeing how sad she was, not talking for about a day after that, I felt extremely guilty, and was offline for a few days. I came back today, and saw that N had vented. A few days ago. Saying I had pushed her into believing everyone hated her and was going to leave. C tried to defend me, saying I was stressed, and then she replied (copied to the best of my memory.)

N: ""Stressed about what?"" ""Making me cry myself to sleep?"" Leading me to catastrophize for days on end?"" ""(My name), we were supposed to be friends, you're not my father."" 

I read that, realised that to everyone on that server I was the bad guy now, and left the server entirely. I feel sick, I have no friends now, I am filled with self-loathing and just can't think of a way forward. I wish none of this ever happened.",-1,-9.896734694,-8.366122449,-7.062857143,-8.620408163

I'm tired of putting my emotions on the table only to not find out about someone 2 years down the road.

I'm tired of being told I can depend on family yet they are the one who bashed my head in and sent me to the hospital

I get run out of everyone's lives so fast and obviously its because my mental health, but fuck.

Wheres my friends when i constantly put their well being before mine? Wheres my friends when i paid for whatever they wanted without asking to be repaid?

Why can't I (19F) just have fun with something intellectually challenging without taking it so personally? 

I just came home from an escape room with my sister (13F). She seemed to have some fun, but for the most part, I was frustrated out of my mind. By the end, I wanted to hurt her and the staff. Badly.

This happens every time. My sister seems to love them, and dad (40M) emotionally pressures me into going with her since it requires at least two people. 

My sister lives with my egg donor, and she only visits periodically. I try to treat her as well as I possibly can in the limited amount of time we spend together, but I'm very short with her in escape rooms, and I feel like I'm part of the reason why she gets so stressed out in them, too—my bad mood has a history of being rather contagious.

For some reason, these things make me so quick to anger. Before I ever went into an escape room, I thought it would be something fun and a little challenging. My intelligence is something
I'm very proud of, and it's helped me to face many obstacles with confidence. 

I endured a lot of abuse when I was younger that was mainly psychological in nature, so in order to push back and survive, I needed to outsmart many people, many of which were considerably older and more powerful than me, so I consider my brain to be no joke. I feel like there's almost no challenge I can't face in that sense. 

But escape rooms? For some embarrassing reason, I just can't handle them. I can't handle the idea of being stumped so badly (and while other people are watching, no less).

At the end of every escape room, one of the staff will come into the room with you and show you how it's done if (when) you don't escape. And every single time, it's only makes me more upset. Either parts of the puzzle are so easy that I feel like an idiot for not figuring them out, or they're so complex that I can't comprehend how ANYONE could solve them. It makes me angry at myself and everyone else in equal measure. 

The most horrible part is that being unable to solve escape room puzzles totally depletes my self-esteem. It's like my brain is screaming at me, “Why can't you do this? Why are you so stupid? It's probably the weed. It's make you a moron, now. It's too late. Your brain is worthless. You might as well die. How are you going to navigate the most basic aspects of adulthood if you can't even do this? You're a pathetic, worthless piece of shit. People lied to you when they said you were smart; they wanted to lead you into a false sense of security. You can't even be nice to your sister in a wittle escape room? Aww, does baby want her bottle? Your identity is a lie. You're not smart. You're a failure.”

And these thoughts are so “loud” that I can't block them out, and they make me fall into a spiral of depression and fury so strong that I can't even describe it much further than that.

Now, I'm completely exhausted, my face feels hot to the touch, and I want to kill myself. Again.

I want to enjoy this. Every time she and I have gone to one of these things, I try to force myself to have fun and to not get too emotionally invested, but I can't. I end up thinking so poorly of myself that I contemplate finding a way to commit suicide right there in the room. 

The anger that I feel... It's stronger than my own body. I lose everything about myself except for the anger. And I feel so helpless because I can't channel it into anything healthy when I'm trapped in a room full of confusing puzzles with a ticking timer. 

I don't know how to feel better right now... I'm so tired that I don't even have the strength to eat. Tying this was a little hard, too, but I had to get this off my chest. I feel miserable—nihilistic, even. I'm regretting everything I've ever done in life, and wondering if I'll ever be able to properly navigate adulthood if I can't even keep my emotions in check.

168sad,sad,"Hi friends, 

This is a throwaway account and I've never talked to anyone about this, but it's something that still affects me deeply, years after the fact. I'm mostly just looking for reassurance, if not a “name” for what happened. It wasn't rape, as I didn't say no or very clearly withdraw consent. But I wanted to super often.

Basically, from high school to early college I was in a relationship with a boy for whom I had to do a lot of emotional labor, before I knew what that was. He had a hard home life and was remarkably well-adjusted considering, but I always felt like more of a safety blanket than a truly valued partner. 

Important context is that I was a very shy teenager. I still struggle to stick up for myself in one-on-one relationships, but I've gotten much better since. He often ignored boundaries I tried to gently set, like personal space, staying past when I wanted him to leave, etc. I always felt incredibly guilty for that. I value personal space, and I'd always have to ask him 3-4 times “when are you thinking of heading out?” “I should get to bed” etc. before he'd even consider leaving. Even when I'd have panic attacks and desperately needed space, he'd say “I don't understand why my being here isn't helping.” It took A LOT for me to even stick up for myself, and when I did he'd just argue and ignore it.

I didn't know what to tell him, and I internalized a lot of that by thinking I just wasn't a very giving girlfriend. But I slowly started to resent spending time with him/being on close proximity to him because of it. Even when we'd be sleeping in the same bed, he'd grab at my chest and just pull me in in a semi-sexual way when I was absolutely not into it. I began physically recoiling from him as instinct, and I still have issues when my current boyfriend touches my chest. 

Anyway, the sex began to feel very one-sided, and being the shy teen I was, I didn't know how to say anything, and I very much felt like it was me being a dysfunctional partner if I didn't commit to regular sex. Here's the important part: I don't remember a time I ever said “no” and he continued sex. But SO often he'd grab me or do something much smaller and I'd have to say “stop” multiple times before he'd stop. There were boundary and consent issues, but it didn't feel that serious at the time because it was little things like touching me too much or grabbing at me when I tried to pull away. My mind didn't really register that as bad, but my body definitely did. 

We both had a very hard time communicating about deeply emotional/intimate stuff - which I don't believe was entirely our faults, as we were young and fairly shy. So we didn't talk about sex. It just became something I decided to endure. I have very vivid memories of just laying there, my face turned away, just clenching my jaw and waiting for him to be done. I'd try to hide some of the discomfort - but another part of me is still grappling with WHY he didn't see that I was uncomfortable/in pain/ just enduring. He had to have known to some degree. I'd sometimes cry after sex because it felt so intimately violating. He'd hold me. But it all felt very retroactive, like he'd continue to do it and handle the fallout afterward. Idk. 

After a while this became normal for me, and there were a couple times where he'd bend me over (so my face was sort of hidden - that was a consensual position) and I'd start to panic so much that tears would be streaming down my face, but I told myself “you just need to let him finish.” Of course, when he saw that I was crying he'd feel bad & hold me. But we wouldn't really talk about it. I felt totally unable to bring it up. 

All of this, coupled with the fact that he cheated on me in a very out-of-left-field, gaslight-y, painful way the year prior fed into the panic and silencing I felt. 

But again, I never verbally withdrew consent. 

About a year after we broke up, though, I started having pretty dramatic flashbacks and panic attacks, all centered around sex and feeling totally out of control of my own body. It's still with me to this day - about 5 years after the fact, and it's become a regular problem in my new relationship (with a really lovely, open partner). I panic and cry a lot during sex. I hate it. I hate him, honestly, and I wish I could make this go away. I hate that it feels like he still has some level of control over my body. 

But, he has no idea. He doesn't know he ever did anything wrong by me, let alone that I'm dealing with this trauma years out. Haven't spoken to him in years. And even though I hate him when this stuff comes back up, I do believe he's a good guy and I wish him well. It's hard to explain. He really just doesn't know.

Basically, I'm really struggling with how to identify and address this, because I can't even justify my feelings to myself. It wasn't rape, it likely wasn't assault because I didn't feel confident enough to communicate or withdraw consent (I still don't know if I WOULD have if I knew how - I felt such a responsibility to just get it done and over with). It's a lot of gray area, and I go back and forth between “he didn't know” and “how the fuck could he not have known?” 

Does anyone have a similar experience or any kind of advice on how to identify/make peace with this kind of trauma? (Calling it trauma still feels disingenuous to me - but it causes me physical panic attacks, so....)",-1,-15.38535995,-6.519963702,-12.99516031,-4.600725953

I stay up in the mornings until it is time for her to have arrived at work and anxiously wait when I know she has left work. I cry nearly everyday thinking about it.

But, for a recent example, my mother wants to go on a vacation and we would have to fly to get there. I'm not sure how it is elsewhere but where I'm from it's allowed to do that to certain places but only with masks on during the entire thing. And here comes the problem I hate wearing masks an have severe social anxiety that already creates problems for me during flights and the restricted air flow can make me panic easily. But since I don't have a physical problem with the masks I'm not allowed to stay home.
Now to my actual question.
I have tried setting boundaries many times from privacy to people who have made me uncomfortable but everyone just ignored me and I don't know what to do and how to go about this, now that it could end up with me having, as a worst-case scenario a panic attack or quite possibly at least a crying fit in a place I can't leave to calm down for up to 3h.",-1,-26.625,-4.791666667,-32.72222222,-8.125

176sad,sad,"Before I go into the full on vent, here's some context: 

- I'm not officially diagnosed however I'm trying to be and this is the conversation I had with my dad less than an hour before making this post.

- I consulted a college phychologist about ADHD, about a month or two before lockdown started, she said she can't 'formally' diagnose me but there is a high chance that I'm correct in my suspicion and there's also a chance that I have aspergers.

- I know I might make it sound bad, but my dad IS trying to be understanding (more so than my mum), he just believes mental health is 'made up' and 'all in your head'. Old fashioned, basically, and is convinced that there's nothing wrong with me and that I'm just believing everything I read on the Internet.

- This is translated and paraphrased from Polish because that's the language me and my dad speak. 

I'm trying to convince my parents to allow me to see a professional and get formally diagnosed and possibly put on some treatment, particularly about ADHD because it's started to seriously affect my college life. This is where today's conversation came in.

I've brought it up with my dad a few times already but I feel like he's dodging the topic, telling me ""yeah talk to your aunt she knows a phychologist"" but not understanding that I want him to sort me out an appointment because one, I'm 17 so I don't think I can get an appointment myself (I Think, I live in the UK but am currently in Poland and my parents would rather me see a Polish professional), and two, I'm too anxious to make the phone call myself and I do want him to be a part of this because I need him to understand.

But today I think I finally convinced him through a very painful conversation. Basically, we got into a bit of a spat earlier today regarding my anti-social spouts, and that I think he takes everything too personally because ""No, I'm not ignoring you on purpose, I just get lost in my own head and don't want to talk or interact sometimes. Sometimes I just dissociate.""

He wants me to constantly be smiling and takes it to heart when I just don't talk or 'seem sad' even though half (Actually like 80%) of the time I'm just thinking/over-thinking and I do have a bit of a resting b*tch face ngl. In all honesty, I don't smile that much, but not because I'm sad it's just I don't feel the need and don't want to. Same goes for constantly having to maintain conversation or ""Behave like I'm happy.""

I started tearing up before I even started the conversation, because I can't handle conflict and I was afraid of how he'll react. I continued to almost cry and aggressively claw at my hand throughout (I can't deal with huge amounts of emotion and start stimming really heavily when I'm even remotely anxious).

I always knew about the ADHD, I just didn't have a name to it until mid-highschool, but I've researched some on Aspergers/autism and noticed that a handful of symptoms align with my behaviour. I told him about a few symptoms I've seen in myself E. G:

Excessive Stimming. Leg shaking, scratching (myself, though that one is mostly when anxious), random snapping of fingers, imitating random noises (Like alarms or animals), and the worst which he can't tell me he doesn't see because he nags me for it almost daily: Pacing. And when I say pacing I mean spending hours walking from wall to wall lost in my own head with headphones, occasionally if I have a particularly intense daydream I tend to 'bounce' off the walls or imitate a few actions in my daydream. 

I've had trouble focusing since childhood, I'd spent lessons in primary zoned out and by the end I wouldn't even remember what happened. It was usually the only thing teachers complained about me. In high school it kinda got better but not really because I still had to constantly snap myself out of daydreams and try really hard not to fall asleep or space out. However, no one ever thought anything of it because I was a 'gifted' kid and tbh I didn't either. I got really good grades in the end but by that age I was starting to become more conscious that the amount of times I lose focus or how I behave in some cases is not normal. 

High emotional sensitivity, leading to an inability to compromise which is the root of 90% of our arguments. I can't argue face to face for the f*cking life of me, even if I know I'm going into a calm debate I just get overly emotional and it affects my ability to form coherent arguments. 

Issues socialising, I only really have two real friends and I don't talk to most people unless spoken to. I'm not on speaking terms with anyone but one of my classmates. I don't catch some social cues, over-share, over-think and over-analyse people's responses, don't know how to start or continue a conversation without the other person doing a fair share of leading the conversation. Dislike of eye contact. An aversion to physical contact, not always, I can get clingy occasionally but like a good 75% of the time I cringe. Heck, even with my own family I sometimes feel unnecessarily awkward. I'm mortified to make important phone calls. Constantly worried about people's opinion of me and seeking out approval. I tend to go into anti-social bouts where I don't wish to be interacted with in any way and would prefer to be left on my own. If I'm already in public, it shows as me being quiet and not contributing at all to the social event going on around me. 

Though this one is a bit of a paradox, because I DO experience spouts of becoming a social butterfly and once you get me started on a topic I'm currently passionate about I don't shut up to the point I tend to over-step what's an acceptable amount to explain. And my dad thinks that is the 'normal' side of me, that I'm normally in the 'social butterfly' mode and that's what he wants me to be all the time. He's starting to get the fact that I need my alone time and that I'm not always a social butterfly, but it makes me incredibly guilty to see him be bothered by my anti-social bouts. 

I want to say I've experienced a few 'special interests' especially as a child and even a few now BUT I'm not so sure on that topic and whether it truly applies to me.

Those are the ones most prominent I've noticed in me.

My dad passes most of those off as normal behaviour, chalking it up to me being a hormonal teenager and that once I'm an adult I'll grow out of all this. Here's the thing though: What if I don't? If I grow up and have it worse as an adult because I didn't do anything about it now? I already went completely under the rader as a kid, one because I was a 'gifted child' and two my parents don't believe in mental illness.

I didn't bring this topic up until high school because I simply didn't have a name to it, nor did I really know or care much about mental health. I'm not claiming to be an expert or anything, but I know what it's like to live inside my own head and can recognise that not everything I do and the way I think is normal. But because ""nothing was wrong with me before"" and ""suddenly you've come up with all these problems that you never mentioned before"" and ""I don't see anything wrong with you"" ""You've been influenced by your friends and the Internet"" ""You don't know what you're talking about"". He thinks that I've convinced myself to having these problems, because I just searched it up on the Internet and cherry picked what applies to me. 

And let's say that OK, maybe I have convinced myself because I've read too much sh*t on the Internet. Isn't it better to see a professional and find out anyway? To finally settle this once and for all instead of me wondering if there's something wrong with me? 

That's kinda what I finally convinced him with, he still thinks there's nothing wrong with me. I feel like I have ruined his holiday though, he was supposed to relax now that he can't really work during the pandemic. He told me how he ""misses the old times when I was a child and would always be smiling and enjoy holidays together without any emotional baggage or problems."" 

He's a good parent and I know he genuinely cares about me but is just incredibly ignorant on the topic of mental health and convinced that it doesn't really exist. (Like he gets everything else right as a dad BUT THIS.)",-1,1.617207792,-7.494805195,-0.670454545,-9.944805195

I also absolutely hate it when people throw around words loosely like ""depressed"", ""I'm so OCD, I need to arrange my pencils in a certain order"" ,"" I didnt eat this morning, I think I have anorexia"". It actually hurts coz it's so much harder to deal with when u actually suffer from it and u know the pain. 

Mental health used to be such a taboo topic. No one even discussed it a few years ago and now u see people joking around about it and romanticizing it. I joke around about suicide and depression coz I feel like I can cope better but when jokes are unnecessarily made, it pisses me off. 

I remember in our psychology class the teacher would always poke fun at the kids who were sleeping and srsly ask them if they had autism which doesn't even remotely make sense but everyone starts laughing as if it's funny, it just feels weird coz I'm actually on the spectrum or my own teacher would tell ppl to go hang themselves and she would have a straight serious face. Her teaching was excellent but she made fucking hippocratic ""jokes"" that she apparently thought were funny. 

I had a friend who wasnt depressed or suicidal or anything. But one day she noticed my self harm scars and told me that they looked cool and beautiful like wat..... and the next day she made self harm scars in designs like drawing carved lightly on her skin and went around the school showing it off. I honestly didnt know what to think of this imao. 

I remember when 13 reasons why came out I fucking loved the show. It was the only show that I had come across which actively talked about mental health and I was so excited and ofcourse i wasnt gonna listen to the warning pfft. The show was rly good. It was my favourite at the time. But I remember crying after every episode and cutting after every episode and attempted suicide after the show, ended up in the ICU came back to life obviously. This was obviously not because of the show, I had already been diagnosed with severe depression along with a few other mental illnesses. It was honestly my fault for watching it despite the warning. However, now I feel that the show did glorify suicide for eg:by showing hannah reacting to the people mourning after her death. Like when u die, ur gonna be gone. U won't know that people will fucking miss u. U wont fucking be there to see how ppl will react after ur death. It almost inserts a false perception into ur head. But I love how it openly talked about mental health issues that needed to be talked about but it was still romanticizing suicide in a way.

I show severe signs of depression and anxiety.

I was doing it to release all of the emotional weight off myself, on top of the fact that i believed and even still believe that i deserved that pain, but no, that woman won't ever just shut up and listen. 
This sense of entitlement that i've seen a lot of parents even today have, its so fucking toxic that if your child honestly starts hating you, you have absolutely no right to call them spoiled or shit kids, because this is your fault, especially if you were given the chance to change and educate yourself on the matter many times in the past. 

My depression wasn't caused by interacting with certain friends mom, it wasn't caused because i read about it IN ORDER to educate myself.

Yes i do, because i decided to not stay shallow and be like you, i decided to educate myself on it, which is apparently too much to ask for from a person that was supposed to take every little bit of responsibility for me when you decided to give birth to me. And no, you don't get a thank you for getting me help, its your job to do that as my mother, it is the bare minimum, just like it is to get me the necessary medical help or clothes or food or a roof under my head.

185sad,sad,"Context: 17F, 18 in a month, living in the US. Going to university in September.

I feel like somethings wrong with me. One of the main reasons is how I react to stress or frustration. When I get frustrated, I tend to harm myself (thankfully not by cutting, I can resist that urge) by punching myself in the face or back of the head repeatedly. If I'm around others I pull my hair. Something about that releases frustration for me, and I never leave visible bruises so I don't really see a problem with it. Then I cry like a baby afterward and it's embarrassing, even though I'm alone 90% of the time when I get like that. After the breakdown I either get a rush of adrenaline or feel drained and empty. 

Another thing is the way I socialise. I can't tell when I've said something offensive or rude until the person gets mad and stops talking to me. And even then I have to ask what I said wrong. I also stutter a lot, have to repeat myself, and backtrack to make sure what I said made sense. I tend to obsess over fictional universes (Steven Universe is a huge obsession right now, going on 8 months) and annoy my friends because that's literally all I talk about, especially if they have no clue what it is. Social events are hell for me because fandoms are the only way I can connect with people, so if it's an event with mainly adults or little kids, I feel alone and awkward. 

I flinch at loud noises, sudden movements, and slight touches despite having never been hit or abused in any way. I've searched every memory from the time I was a little kid and can't remember a single time I was hit maliciously (fights with my brother don't count because we never went for each other's faces).

Physically I use my hands as a nervous habit a lot. Years ago I realised that when I walk, my arms hang like everyone else's but felt wrong, so now I constantly play with my hands. Cracking knuckles, moving my fingers around, snapping, and even digging my nails into my skin are my main nervous habits. If I'm really stressed or anxious I bite my fingers.

There's a lot more but this is already pretty long and incoherent, so I'll spare you guys the trouble. But from this post, does it sound like something's wrong and I should find a therapist? Or am I overthinking this entirely and I'm normal?",-1,-17.46047431,-3.464426877,-3.280632411,-9.634387352

About 4 years ago my Mother was diagnosed with ALS and given maybe a year to live. Me, my Dad and my Sister were there to support her for the next 9 months as she slowly stopped being able to talk and to eat on her own. The ALS really only effected her mouth and throat. After about 9 months she eventually ended up vomiting, aspirating it, and getting a severe repository infection. Her immune system couldn't keep up anymore and she died.

Ever since then I have temporarily dropped out of high school at grade 11 because of the stress it was causing me. I have been to a few different councillors and have been on Prozac for depression for a while. About two years ago I came off the Prozac and seemed okay.

It is now 6 days till the 3rd anniversary of her death and for the last 2 weeks I have been cripplingly afraid of dying. Not of when it will happen but of the endless nothingness afterward. I know that it is somewhat irrational but my brain keeps saying it isn't.

Over the last week I have gotten slightly better by just talking to my Dad and my consultant that I've known for 8 years and I am trying to make an appointment with another councillor. But with COVID-19 it is getting pretty difficult to get into somewhere.

Luckily, I haven't been suicidal at any point.

I mentioned to my Dad yesterday that it might be some sort of PTSD from the 9 month period because any time I hear death mentioned I have what is basically a small panic attack. I have not been in contact with anyone outside my family for the last 6 months but I'm not very social anyway.

I came here hoping someone has some advice or maybe had even been in the same sort of situation before. If you have any questions please feel free to ask.

Long story short, I give up as soon as I can to go back to doing nothing (gaming, internet etc). College took a break for Coronavirus and tried to do online stuff but didn't do a good job of it. I saw the opportunity and ""sub-consciously"" took it. I say that with quotes because I barely feel like I'm making logical decisions anymore, my body just says words and I live with the consequences later . I put in a letter of 'paused study' which means I take a break and pick up next semester. Studying online felt rough since I kept having to ask the lecturer questions on almost anything that we covered and even then I wasn't getting it.

My mum is extremely disappointed since she knows she didn't raise me with those kinda morals and she's right she didn't but I can't pull myself out of the 16 year long depression that I've been in. Every opportunity I've ever had has been screwed up either by me or by random circumstances. I lost all motivation to continue and I just can't be bothered with anything outside of gaming etc. Mum's put a lot of effort into motivating me with stuff and occasionally asks me how getting back into college is going, which I just get mad at her and try and shift the blame or attention somewhere else (either to a lecturer or an email not getting replied to).

That leads to tonight where she broke down and said she can't do it anymore. This has happened before and its for the same reasons. But this time felt different as she asked me what I wanted to do with my life, truly. I told her I don't want to do anything, I don't like the world with the people in it they're all greedy and self-centered etc etc. I understand there's some people out there who aren't like that but they are almost always superseded by a dozen of others. I told her I didn't want to live in that world and she said ""You want to kill yourself!?"" to which I agreed. I remember that since I was about 6 I was sitting in the bath with her next to me as ""I cried out I don't wanna live anymore"". I didn't think much of it but I noticed she immediately got more upset.

She got up and walked away and I followed her out. She turned to me and said ""Fine I'll say it. Kill yourself if you want to. I know that's what you've been waiting for someone to say"". It's true, it hit me hard but its true. I had been waiting 16 years for someone I loved to seriously tell me that. But as soon as she said it she started crying since, well, no mother should feel like they have to say those words. She walked away again and I followed her and gave her a hug as she told me how I keep blaming others and getting mad at her for trying to help. About wasted potential and squandered opportunity.

I just, I can't ever care about anyone other than myself. I don't feel empathy or sympathy towards other people, I don't get happy or sad. I used to get angry but that's dialed back a lot in the last few years. I think the best way to describe my emotions is ""disappointed"" and ""not-disappointed"". If someone says they're going to do something and they do it, I'm not disappointed in that even if they did a great job on it I still feel the same. If they don't do it then I'm disappointed and I just try and forget that we ever had an interaction and go back to doing 'nothing'. When I'm doing 'nothing', my mind is focused on the task at hand and I don't have time for emotions. I just do what I think will progress me to more content either something good to watch or best decision in a video-game.

I've done a couple jobs and courses around the place, work for the dole type deals. None have lasted more than a year and the first study I chose to do I didn't finish since I missed one assignment and they said I had to redo it, so surprise I didn't do it. I once had to move up north of the city (am currently south of it) for some work with a random company who promised a short course and guaranteed work at the end. I spent 3 months with them and then 1 week with a ""sister company"" for $150. They lied about work and the qualification they provided wasn't anything besides manual labour. When I asked them about the work they pawned me off to the owner's sister's friend's company who lied about how I didn't need my license.

I do stuff around the house, I'm respectful to guests and the rest of the family here. Mum says I'm a smart guy who could do well if he put in the effort. I'm taking medication that seemed to improve me from who I was before I started taking it. I've seen I believe 7 psychologists and nothing much has come of it besides the medication and saying how I don't have Borderline Personality Disorder.

I don't know what to expect from this lengthy post, its a vent but its also an admission of guilt. Guilt I feel is about how I'm emotionally a void. I cry when others cry or talk about something I've done in the past I'm not proud of. I don't remember the last time I was happy, only the times when something has made me laugh. We all make mistakes but I don't know how to fix this one.

 No I'm not going to kill myself.

189sad,sad,"Hi all,

I'm near the end of high school in Australia and I'm finding myself in a difficult place. Until a year ago, I was doing very well in school and I expected to do very well last year and this year, but I didn't. The problems I've faced include:
- Perfectionism resulting in procrastination due to inability for every assignment to be perfect
- Executive dysfunction (this has always been a problem but I've reached the point where the work is difficult enough that this impacts my grades)
- Emotionally abusive household
- Burnout

I try my hardest despite these but I've repeatedly failed and others have berated me for it, making me feel I don't deserve to exist. But not only am I scared of failure, I'm also scared of success. I don't like being praised or otherwise knowing that I'm doing well from others (grades, money, etc.) because it makes me feel like I'm being moulded and manipulated into what someone else wants me to be - not *who I am.*

I don't want to be a drone, but I don't to be a failure. I don't want to freeload, but I don't want to work. I don't want to be pathetic, but I don't want to be successful. I don't want to be traumatised, but I don't want to heal because I don't know what I feel and think besides all of the negative thoughts.

But, I don't know what I *do* want, either. I've recently come to the realisation that all my dreams and aspirations are really just my interpretation of what I think others expect of me and I never really wanted to do any of it. Still, I don't have something I want to do besides all this. I'm not even one of those kids who has the wild daydream fantasy of playing video games for a living - I can't imagine a single thing that I *want* to do.

About the only thing I think I want is to move out of home to escape my condescending parents, and that's about it. I have no additional plans besides working a job that I haven't decided on and finding a close friend to heal with.

**How do I learn to look inwards and discover who I am; who I want to be; what my identity is?** I don't know who I am and I don't know who I want to be. I can't even describe or know my interests, my goals (besides that immediate one), my personality, or even my *gender* and I don't know how I will discover them. All I see when I look inwards is a pathetic, hurt wreck, but I know that that's not me - that's my trauma.

Also, **how can I decide that success is a good thing and get over my fear of it, including my fear of being successful at healing?** Yes I am scared of success, but I know that I'll be happier once I'm not because if I aspire to be successful, I'll have more money or more spare time or more happiness or whatever it is that I discover that I want. I'm even scared of being successful at overcoming my trauma, and the dilemma between healing and not healing has kept me awake at night.

I feel like I'm on an entirely separate plane of existence from everyone else.

I've been getting treatment for anxiety and depression for years now but it all feels like a dead end. Every time I tell my family I'm depressed their only advice is to ask for a new medication. I'm fucking sick of meds. I've been on countless meds since I was 12 for one thing or another and I hate them. The ones I'm on right now make me vomit if I don't eat a full meal before taking them. 

I only ever have about as much energy as it takes to get from my bed to the bathroom every day, let alone work and eat and do functional people things, but no one seems to take me seriously. It's always “man that sucks” or “I feel that” or “have you been taking your meds?”. I get no help from anyone that actually means anything. I feel like I'm screaming into a void and no one is actually paying attention. I feel so incredibly alone. 

I've never really had suicidal tendencies because I am terrified of death, but the idea of taking off in my car and never coming back gets more appealing by the day. I've even daydreamed of going to sleep and just not waking up. Not dying, just not waking up. Never having to deal with any of this ever again.

I do not recognize myself if I look in the mirror and it is hard for me to feel attacted to my own limbs and other body parts. If I'm sitting in a group I feel like a shadow creeping in on normal humans. On my own I question if my body functions in a way that is human or if I'm some how completely wrong and poorly replicating it.

I have been diagnosed with depression, social anxiety and PTSD but never deeply divulged the extent of my feelings or lack of towards my body to any health worker. More and more recently I have felt that I am living without actually having an active role in my life. 

Idk why I'm posting this just that I need to get the thoughts out. I'm 21 almost 22 and feel as if I've not actually lived a life but just performing tasks that are expected of me. Worse is that my ""alien"" feelings are becoming confirmed in my mind as I get older. I've never had a relationship or even a mutual liking towards someone. I don't have close friendships or family members. At school I'm unnoticeable and unremarkable.This was unchanged by covid and while everyone around me finds it hard being alone its been my default. I've tried to change the social relationships around me and improve on my outside physical vessel but it never seems to work. 

I've concluded I've failed at being human. And although I've resisted suicidal thoughts as much as possible it's becoming easier imagining that if I'm dead it leaves space and resources to someone that is actually human. And my death is for the betterment of those around me to eliminate and reallocate the resources extended to my body. So at this point the only thing stopping me from ending it is not having the energy or willpower. So I guess rn I'm just gonna keep my body going like an old broken down vehicle that only runs some of the time and never quite right.

In elementary school, I had a friend who was jealous of me, she would talk about me behind my back and even gaslighted my best friend about me and another one who would put me down constantly. Middle school, I had a falling out with a close friend every year because of bs or because they betrayed my trust or me as a person. The worst year was 7th grade. Before I moved, I was friends with a group of boys and I started dating one of them and one of the guys started bullying me relentlessly until I moved. Then that summer when I made friends at my new school, one of my friends let my other friend who I had a falling out with go off on me via text. 9th grade, two of my friends became closer with each other and ultimately pushed me out of the group (I believe it was unintentionally though because I don't have ill feelings about them) and another friend started ignoring me out of nowhere.

I'm just at a complete loss of what to do.

I've never been known to be the kind of person to stand up for myself. If being complacent meant keeping another person happy, then I'd have no problem doing so.

However, I'm sitting in bed at 3 A.M. completely angry and frustrated because I've let people walk over me for too long.

My big issue at the moment is that I'm currently living with my grandma and she brought a guy into the house. My parents had moved out of the house and I stayed behind while my friend moved in. This was an arrangement I was happy with. Both my friend and I would pay rent to my mom each month and we would both live in the house. Then one day, my mom told me my grandma was moving in because she was breaking up with her current boyfriend and had nowhere else to stay. I wasn't too bothered by it at the time. She kept to herself and never really intruded around the house.

Not too long after she moved in, my friend was evicted for not paying rent which left my grandma and I. Because he was gone and my grandma kept to herself, the house started to feel like my own. I managed to pull myself out of a depression and began making the house my own. I would cook, spend time in the living room which I had personally furnished. I felt comfortable in what was essentially my own home.

Then around the same time, I feel like my grandma felt the same way. She began decorating. Placing photos on desks which I was using for my own stuff. Placing questionable figurines and art around the house (a notable one being that of a small indian man which scares me just about every night because it looks so realistic.) The decorating wouldn't have been such an issue had it not been so intrusive. I had made the living room to my personal liking (considering the fact I never used the living room even when my family lived here). She also began cooking questionable meals that were either barely cooked, made with completely crazy ingredients (such as a burrito with bologna, ketchup, and mashed potatoes), or were murdered with salt. Because she was always cooking, I lost my own desire to cook and just began getting takeout every day; something that she essentially makes fun of me for.

I could put almost all of this aside and live peacefully with her (and I did) until a few weeks ago when I came home to a car that I had never seen before. I assumed it might be one of my cousin's cars who frequently makes visits. It was also very late so I didn't think too much of it. I was in the living room the next morning and a man I had never seen before comes walking in with my grandma behind him. She introduces him and says that he's her new boyfriend. Again, I let it slide. She probably met him a little while back and best case scenario, she can move in with him or it'll be a small relationship and I'll never see him again.

Then one day, I came home and one of my dogs was tied up, one was in a cage essentially crying for me, and when I walked into the house, I discovered the entire living room carpet was gone and all the furniture was rearranged. I asked my grandma about it and she said that her boyfriend wanted to get rid of the carpet to replace it with new carpet and that she was afraid that the dogs would run away (which they won't considering they never have).

To wrap up my issues, I am actually extremely angry that this man I've never met before is essentially moving himself in and making changes to a house I just now started to become comfortable in. I wanted to talk to my mom about it tomorrow because she's the one who owns the house but I know the conversation will not go in my favor. She'll probably just tell me that it's best if I moved out which is an awful idea. I have such a connection to this house because as a kid, we were moving around so much. The longest house I had lived in prior to this one was no more than 4 years. Finally, now that I have a house that I feel is my own, it's being completely intruded on. And I wouldn't be able to afford my own place considering my job pays like crap (I could leave that job but that's a whole can of worms and another essay long as to why I haven't left). And I can't rightfully leave that job because it's owned locally and the boss relies on me so heavily that leaving would ruin our admittedly good relationship and possibly make his business harder to run.

In short, I feel like a house I've just learned to love is being intruded on and there's very little I can do about it besides make myself seem like a bad person in my grandma's eyes.

I have no idea what to do. I feel like I have no control over my own life. And if I do attempt to take control, I'm an asshole. I'm trapped.

Unfortunately, this is just the basis of my issues at the moment and it feels like it's boiling over badly. I've fallen back into my depression, have been drinking a lot, and am just generally angry and exhausted all the time. If I don't make some kind of change, I'm afraid I might just snap.",-1,-3.840120664,-1.108597285,-9.370286576,-8.738687783

203sad,sad,"I am an empathetic person. I care about social and political issues and the people being affected. I have been like this all my life. But recently especially(because of the current state of the world and the political climate) I have been exposed to a lot of information, news, events, things said/done by celebs etc about issues on literally every possible topic. I see the problems, the bad, and the things I find disgusting and horrible but get sucked in. Several people in my life have asked me why I care and get involved in things that don't directly affect me. Well for example, im not black, but physically cannot ignore the injustices they face. I care and advocate for black people and the racism towards them disgusts me. And the events that have been happening recently I can't seem to stay away and just “not care” like others in my life because “im not involved”. But in general, stuff like this takes a toll on me so much that I feel like it takes up a lot of my day and mind. The thing is I want to be informed and educated. However, I feel guilty, lazy, careless, and privileged to ignore all the things that are happening. I get angry and emotional and depressed and sad and anxious and basically all of the above. And I feel like every time i scroll on anything like twitter ig snap or see news articles and videos, I just continuously see the horrible things going on and can't not look into it. I find out all the things happening and then it stays on my mind. My mom told me that I shouldn't care so much and to just ignore it because I can't do anything anyways and there's no point. but I feel bad bc of reasons mentioned above and also i feel like being informed, sharing info, finding petitions, and donation pages to send money to do help people a lot and do make change. So my question is, how do I stay informed and educated without being sucked in and making it all have a negative effect on my mental health. How do I also calmly discuss topics that are sensitive and controversial without getting mad sad or emotional especially when there are actually certain people out there that have disgusting views and morals that when hearing from I want to throw them into a brick wall lol.

205sad,sad,"My daughter is a year and two months. I love her to death. She is my everything in this entire world. I could lose everything else, but as long as I have her, I'll be fine.

A little to explain...

I was homeless when I found out I was pregnant with her. I am an abuse victim from both my childhood and my adulthood. I have childhood Dissociative PTSD with trauma based hallucinations, GAD and Depression that worsened with my Ex. I had just been kicked out by my grandmother. My abusive father gave me up to her after years of mental, physical and S-xual abuse as a minor. When I was kicked out due to my grandmother not liking my friends and my severe mental breakdown. I couldn't work, go to school and I could barely leave the house due to my dissociation. She forced me to go back to work too soon with the threat of kicking me out, which caused me to lose my job. I started getting better but still wasn't working as often as they would like me too. So, they pushed all of my bills and $500 of rent on me to force me to start working more.

 I decided to get away and go on a 4 day vacation with someone they never met. While I was gone my grandmother had to be hospitalized for high blood pressure and I couldn't get back into town. When I returned I was told I was never allowed back. The house, everything was locked, even the garage. She thought I was with my friends from school that she didn't like. So, I was kicked out. 

I ended up moving in with someone who turned out to resemble my father. Controlling, manipulative, abusive. Just a terrible human being. I couldn't work, leave the house. He worked offshore for two weeks at a time. I would be alone for two weeks having to ration out my food. The one time I left without his permission while he was there, he forced me back inside and forced himself on me while screaming in my face how terrible of a human being I was. My daughter was sadly conceived through a day of force.

I ended up leaving him and went homeless, only to find out I was pregnant three days in. I planned on aborting but was denied twice due to my poor mental health. My ex told me that he did not want this child to live, but didn't want anything bad to happen to me. Under any circumstances. He didn't want her to live. Therefore. He was gone. He doesn't know that she is alive. Her name. Where she is. His name isn't on her birth certificate. No one on his family knows she is alive.

I moved in with my mother who I hadn't lived with in years after two weeks of homelessness. I went to file a restraining order but since it was past a months time, they couldn't do anything.

I had an angry pregnancy where I didn't want to feel her move, see her photos, talk about her. When she was born, I had to learn to separate her from my abuse. Learning that it wasn't her fault. I worked hard on learning to bond and love her. 

Yet, now. I seem to depend on her. I feel like we have been through so much together. Even though she wasn't born and didn't have to experience it. I feel very protective over her. To the point I'm willing to end any and all relationships that may get cross. I feel bad, but I scold my boyfriend (Who I met at 5-6 months pregnant) if he gets too frustrated with her. I feel bad because I told him that if it comes down to her or him, it will be her everytime. If I have a bad PTSD night, She is in bed with me and just looking at her makes me feel like I can breathe.

My daughter gets very clingy with me as well, but I know that is just a toddler thing. I go through days where I just need to be able to see her. It makes it hard to work and do normal things. As I speak she is laying next to me in bed where I can watch her tiny sleeping face. I get nightmares and I need her. I have trouble sleeping and I need her. I'm having a bad day and I need her. I'm upset and I need her.

I just feel like there is something connected so deeply in my past trauma with the two of us. That we survived together. We made it out alive together. We want each other... Yet, at the same time, I know that it's just me. It's just my brain trying to attach itself to something so I feel less alone, scared and traumatised. That I attached myself to her so I feel like I'm not alone in my trauma. That I'm sharing it with someone and we are making it through together... But it was me. Not her. I did. And it makes me feel so alone. I try so hard not to cry in front of her. My father did that to me while he slit his wrists. I remember how terrible it felt. I do my hardest not too... But it just gets to be so hard sometimes. I don't know how to set healthy boundaries with her. She isn't my therapist. She isn't a coping doll. She's a human being and she shouldn't be forced to be my comfort item.

206sad,sad,"(First paragraph is context) My Uncle David was not supposed to live past his 5th birthday and has proved that wrong by being a beautiful and amazing influence in my family's life for over 50 years. He was born to my grandmother, his birth father left before the end of the pregnancy and his entire side of the family wanted nothing to do with my grandmother and her downs child. He has obviously created a lot of issues and obstacles in her life but she eventually found a man that would accept David for who he is rather than what he has. I digress, David has like I said; created a lot of obstacles but was a loving big brother to his siblings including my mother; along with all of his nieces and nephews. This stands out to me more than most because I grew up with him being around and being the first grandchild I was given a lot more attention by the family than the predecessors. I live him almost as much as he loves me and that is why I feel obligated to help as much as possible even if I can't schedule doctor's appointments. 

Roughly 2 years ago, David moved out of my grandparent house and began living with my mother. Things were normal as they could be and everything seemed well. My grandfather has taken a job 2 hours away and they could not take David with them, my mother volunteered to take care of her big brother while they were away. 

My grandparents returned home after my grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer. She went through all the treatment and she is now a survivor and cancer free. They performed multiple surgeries and she was bandaged and bedded at home for some time. Everyone decided that David needed to stay at my mom's house longer until my grandmother fully recovered due to David being very sensitive when he is aware that his family members are ""hurt"" or ""sick."" He usually becomes overwhelmingly concerned and upset especially when his mother is sick; so it is safe to say that was a good call.

The issues began maybe 3 months ago. My mother ran into a mouse problem in her house while David was staying there. They mice were quickly exterminated and it was not an issue. I moved out of my mother's house as did my step-brother. Maybe a week before I left, David began having sleeping issues. He would stay awake all night even without any distractions. He would lay or sit in his bed throughout the night and then get up when everyone finally awoke for the morning. He would then be very drowsy and tired throughout the day and even falling asleep at dinner and outside. He would get maybe 2 hours of sleep throughout the day with 20 minute intervals of dozing off. 

This seems all quite standard, he just has sleeping issues. This is were things get disturbing, David began talking about seeing mice. He would describe them like a six year old would describe a nightmare about rats. He says they have bitten him, hit him, squeaked at him, and just generally distracted him from sleeping. This was assumed to be an excuse for him not sleeping as he often makes immature excused for a lot of his behavior. However after some time we all realized that his in genuinely seeing mice and he isn't lying about it. He would point in a dark corner and say ""there's a mouse"" after investigating and discovering there is no mouse he would accept is and laugh. 

We cleaned out his entire bedroom, moved furniture and moved him into a different room, to no avail. David would talk about seeing a mouse or some mice in various locations where he sleeps. He was scared of them and David is very hard to scare. He loves horror and is never scared by anything other than real danger. His voice shakes and he tries his best to explain his terror. 

Everyone decided it was time for him to come home, he needed to be back in his parents house and maybe he would be able to sleep and stop seeing mice. I have been staying with them and helping keep an eye on him. Everything seemed fine for maybe a week. He went to the doctor, they gave him some sleeping medicine and he slept well for maybe 5 nights. Now, he is back to being unable to sleep, he takes his pills and he still just sits and lays there. He whispers to me and says, ""there's a mouse under the bed."" I tell him there is no mouse, I look under the bed I confirm there is no mouse and he is alright, an hour later he is back at it. Yesterday, he came outside where I was swimming and brings me his shoe and says there is a mouse inside of it. I turn it over, sake it, put my hand inside, beat it on the wall, and say ""no mouse in here."" He accepted it and walked off with a smile. Maybe 10 minutes later, I see him investigating the shoe, looking down the sole, shaking ti, beating it out, doing everything I did except putting his hand inside. He was handling the shoe in a way you would expect someone to handle a shoe if there was a mouse inside, expecting it to fall out. 

Me and my family are at a dead confusion, my grandparents are little help as there are old and tend to have the ""shake it off"" mentality. With Covid, it is hard to get an appointment. I have thought of ideas including buying snake food mice and killing them in front of him to maybe shake this. We thought that bringing him home would take care of it. He is getting drained by this endevour and it is making him incredibly depressed.

212sad,sad,"

bit of a vent sesh as well, my apologies. there's a lot going on in my head as i type this. 

a little context: i grew up in an abusive/neglectful home. father being the abuser, mother being the neglectful one. my father is now out of the picture (thank god) but i still live w my mom. i didn't realize my home life wasn't ideal until about 15. things my father should've gotten arrested for i thought everyone experienced until my friends at the time told me otherwise. my whole life i've made light of the situation, i've never really felt affected by my childhood, just thought it made me more independent, which is a valuable skill, so why be upset over something i'm not dealing with anymore and made me stronger?

because i was a kid. i didn't need strength i needed safety. and i've only come to that realization recently. only over the past month or so has it set in what i've really experienced and how awful it was. and i draw connections from my problematic habits now (such as allowing myself to be used by men because i want to help them, or more generally putting people before myself to an extreme).

all the time i make jokes about daddy issues. it's funny because i'm functional. i've been told i'm “doing surprisingly well” for someone who's gone through what i have. and i'm inclined to agree. until i realize that, again, i'm not living as people are supposed to. it makes me furious my dad has this effect on my life. i don't care about him, so why am i still hurting? but the same thing happens with my other forms of trauma as well.

i make jokes. i don't even notice when it happens sometimes. watching people overdose, having someone try to kill you, rape, etc. are all trauma. all of these i've experienced. and i never think it's a big deal til i'm pulling at my hair, sweating, sobbing, and punching my bed at 4 in the morning. that's when i think i need therapy. til i stop about an hour or two later, go to bed, and forget about it. these episodes come about every couple days. sometimes they're less severe (sudden tears and silent sobbing for a couple minutes, not feeling and wiping the tears away for a couple minutes, repeat for an hour). i don't like that i don't know my own emotions, and i don't know how to handle them. my only coping mechanisms are unhealthy and self destructive, and that was with stuff that bothered me less than this. i'm a little scared i could do some real damage to myself if i let my emotions get the best of me and can't find a healthy way to handle this on a daily basis.

213sad,sad,"I just want to preface this by saying I'm not gonna kill myself anytime soon. I just really really want to.

One of my problems is that I have a really hard time opening up to anyone about any of my problems, especially family. I just know that if I tell them any problem I'm having that's what they're gonna think of anytime they think of me. I just keep up an image of a guy who really doesn't care about anything and is always looking on the bright side, even though that couldn't be further from the truth. 

I'm 16, so I still live at home with my parents, which means I have to go through them to get any mental health services. Earlier this year, things finally got so bad that I asked my parents to see a therapist, by saying it was because of stress at school. I already could barely stand telling my parents this, but then it got so much worse. I made the mistake of telling my therapist I was cutting, and then he told my parents. And now they know I'm a cutter, and now I know they think of me as a cutter. After they found out, I could barely talk to them anymore and I because a lot more withdrawn. I couldn't stand being around them, because I knew what they were thinking. 

It got bad enough that I told my therapist I might try to kill myself, and he sent me to a psych ward. It was absolute hell. Now my parents think of me as a psych patient. And now I know every time my parents see me they see a psych patient. Each time they visited me I could barely talk to them, it hurt like red hot fire. When I got discharged I guess they realized I really didn't want to talk about this anymore so they didn't bring it up. But I know they're still thinking about it. I know every time I see them. I've managed to keep up the charade of being happy, playing it off as a miraculous recovery and I'm 100% fine now for sure. But I know they know that's not the case. I know they're still thinking of me like that. I know they know I'm lying.

But now my birthday is coming up, and our family has a tradition of talking about everything going on in the past year. I'm dreading this, because even if they don't mention it, I know for sure they're going to be thinking about what happened to me. And I know it's gonna be absolute hell to me. And I can't tell them that I can't do it this year, because then they're gonna need a reason. And I can't give them a reason because that's even worse.

I've stuck bandaid over bandaid on all my problems and they're so dangerously close to bursting off. What do I do? 

I don't know why I care about this stuff so much, but I do. Anyone I'm close to knowing any problem I'm having quite literally worse than death. I just hate it so much, and it's preventing me from doing so much. What do I do?",-3,-11.91295547,-3.25708502,-15.14237517,-6.811740891

I've been struggling with depression and anxiety my whole life, from what I have been told by a psychiatrist years ago I understand it's probably genetic (I have not looked further into it so apologies if its actually impossible, but there is a pattern running up my maternal line). There was a period of time in school (from ages ~12-18) where I was suicidal, but lazy. I wanted to die, I just didnt want to go through with the effort. I tried strangling myself, overdosing on my psych medication, I held a knife to my wrists, but I just couldn't do it. Maybe I was afraid of doing it myself, afraid it would hurt, or just afraid of it while simultaneously wanting it. I dont know.

I've been out of high school for a few years now and began college after a period of self exploration, and I guess you can say that I'm doing better. If I wasn't afraid of death before, I can safely tell you that I am now. I am truly afraid of death, and its keeping me awake at night. I cry and get anxious and sad because I know theres nothing I can do about it. I love my parents, but there will always be a small part of me that hates them because they created me knowing I would die some day, that it would hang over me until it inevitably happened, and that I would lose a lot of people I hold dear to the very thing I am afraid of along the way. I want to stop driving a car/going on the road  (and a lot more things) because I know one accident could end it all. I dont stop doing these things, because I know my life would be more miserable without them.

 I'm angry and frustrated that no matter what I do, how hard I work, I will die no matter what. I could live the best life or the worst, it's all going to end either way. One of my greater fears is getting some sort of brain degenerative disease (which also runs in the family, so it is a possibility), to lose my dignity and my memories and me. Part of me hopes for it, so that I wouldnt have to know that I would be in the process of dying. 

I have mostly stepped out of the wanting to die stage in my life (hopefully for good) and now I have crippling anxiety and anger following me around. Every once in a while I have a split second thought that I should just get it over with so that I dont have to deal with it anymore, but I never act on it nor do I want to. Even if I did, I would have a panic attack before I could even do anything.  I have a lot of things I value in life to go so soon.

It's really fucking me up. I'm really struggling right now and when I go to professionals to reach out and say I'm struggling, they ask me what I'm experiencing.

222sad,sad,"I feel like I have no right to complain or to be sad at all...

I made a mistake that changed everything, and I got hurt by others as well, which is fine.

But, when I start feeling depressed or nervous, I get told that pretty much I don't have any right to complain, and that I should ignore what everyone else says and just focus on myself.

Four months of isolation thanks to the pandemic didn't help either.

I realized that I made a mistake by taking 100% of the blame... I have at most 50% of it, as they were people who hurt me when I didn't do anything to deserve it.

Aside from a few people, I'm alone, and when I say alone, I mean the type of crippling loneliness that burns you with frostbite from the inside.

I awake to an empty What's App most of the time, I deactivated my Facebook account because I was tired of being left in seen again and again, and I don't really use social media to talk to others anymore aside of Reddit.

These days I've been feeling terrible, I ended up shivering from an anxiety attack at Friday, I get cold feet a lot, sometimes my stomach hurts or I overeat to calm down, it takes me in between 30-60 minutes to get asleep, I can't focus to study or do homework properly now that I'm back in class and so on...

And if life is focused on ""utility"", rather than honor or respect... Then I ended up being a tool for many people, and once I fulfilled my purpouse, they discarded me.

I will have to do months or years of therapy, just to become somewhat functional... Only to ignore what everyone else says or thinks, and just focus 100% on myself, while waiting for some miracle to happen.

Some people are strong enough to live on their own, to not need friends and just be happy with themselves, which is perfectly fine. But I'm not one of those people, nor I could become like that even if I tried...

In a nutshell, people can hurt me, betray me, manipulate me, use me and then discard me, treat me like garbage or just with pure indifference, and that's perfectly fine.

But, when I start feeling depressed or bad, because it's just too much, I'm the one who's wrong, I'm the one who should ignore everyone else, be positive, accept my circumstances and keep shut about it.

I'm mostly alone and isolated, my support structure is very, very small, they'll probably give us more and more homework and group projects at online classes (which make me very nervous to think about)... I feel like I want to snap.

There's no mercy, forgiveness or compassion for me... Just indifference, pain and loneliness...

I don't know what else to do... If I don't make therapy work it'll be useless, my stomach can't handle most pills and so on...

I guess I wasn't meant to be happy... Once I messed everything up, I have to accept that I'll surely have a broken, lonely and empty future...

I feel like I will eventually end up taking my life, because I keep losing and losing, and life keeps telling that I have no right to complain, and that there's no turning back from the past...

I don't know how much I will be able to last like this, I don't want to hurt my family or remaining friends, but the pain keeps growing day after day...",-3,-5.164851785,-4.473684211,-17.01421658,-1.769509982

But now I don't know, the motivation I had isn't there anymore with the exception of occasional bursts that disappear as fast as they arrive

I want to be able to sit down and talk through my feelings, even if just to myself. But doing that feels impossible because I immediately get overwhelmed with emotions. As if just thinking about who I am results in my mind defending itself by scaring me into distracting myself and when I confronted those feelings recently they made me scared to go to sleep.

I don't know what to do, as I haven't had anything like this before but I have had these emotions for a few months now and probably started 2 years ago and have slowly grown

What I want to do is become motivated again into aiming toward goals but I don't even have goals anymore, not ones that feel in reach anyway

Recently I have also been feeling as if I am constantly battling two sides of myself. One side is happy and feels like it's without a care, and the other one is one that just wants to ruin myself, whether it be telling other people about my emotions or contemplating self harm.

225sad,sad,"I have been struggling with depression and anxiety since the age of eight. I remember how, from one day to another, with seemingly no explanation, I started being scared of sleeping at night, I was especially scared of silence. I borrowed a FM radio from my parents and would fall asleep listening to a French comedy channel so as to keep my mind from having dark/scary thoughts. Today, I am 27, and my anxiety and depression grew to where it paralyses me and makes me unable to achieve anything. Even the smallest task feels like climbing a mountain. I quit my job because I would start crying in the middle of my shifts or hide because my stomach would hurt from anxiety. I only feel good for a couple minutes a day and it's often mixed with a feeling of melancholy.  I have a dream of having a musical career, I have been working towards this goal for 12 years and yet have nothing to show for it. I tried meditating, exercising, I took supplements, made sure to eat healthy, sleep on schedule... I am so tired of always feeling like I am dragging my body behind me wherever I want to go and making my family worry for me. I am terrified of continuing to live like this...

Inside of me, I still believe that there has to be a way to get out of this. Despite just how hopeless it can feel at times, I've not lost my optimism yet. But I also realized that I cannot do this alone. 

I finally made peace with the idea of seeking help but I cannot afford it. Do you know of any organizations/associations that are helping people who can not afford to get help by providing them with therapy & or other?

I dont exactly know where the root cause is, but I feel like its partly thanks to my parents who didnt force me to socialize when I was a child (it was of course my choice too tough) and now Im scared of talking to other people. So far my only friends were those from school, who are now leaving me in the dust (I havent told them anything about my mental state so far, Im basically wearing a mask in public, but I still dont feel confident). Its also important to say Im scared of talking to them too, so thats basically killing even those friendships. Recently I have tried out Discord, but even there im too scared to start a conversation or even say a single word. I feel anxious even when Im just simply sending text messages over there, or somewhere else (even right now). Overall Im definetly way too self conscious about myself, I usually think of things like: am I funny,  am I annoying, do I look bad right now, do I have a bad expression and stupid things like that, it might sound fucking ridiculous to a normal person, but I get stressed over those things, think of the worst outcome and finally I doubt myself like Im some kind of weirdo that shouldnt be interacting with people. I think I might have grown a social phobia inside of me thats gonna make me even sadder and probably lead to depression (I might already suffer from it).

234sad,sad,"So pretty much what happened was a lot. It started in November 2019, I couldn't eat, and would throw up a lot, still don't know what was up with that, it went on until April 2020, it's just kinda been shrugged off as anxiety. It got really bad in January, I was down 12 pounds from already severely underweight and in and out of the hospital almost constantly. This caused me to have 59 attendence strikes 2nd semester, for a triple honors class kid going into concert season, it was really bad with low grades and missing work. But all of that was minute compared to February. 

On one of the last days in January my now ex asked me to meet him somewhere and I did, no big deal, we're dating, probably a pop date or something. Long story short I got raped. Or at least I think I did? He wanted to do sex and I did not. I told him no but he kept saying ""come on, don't you love me?"" ""Don't you trust me?"" And pushing me back against this one wall in the dugout we were in until I just kind of nodded. It wasn't vaginal penetration cause he simply couldn't find it, but it was anal and it hurt like a bitch. There was no pleasure and I wanted to stop after it first started but he said no, that we would be fine, that we were too far in to stop and that I should relax and enjoy it. I didn't even moan, there was simply no feeling. I just kinda let my mind go blank, like retreating into my head or go afk but in real life. I wish I had struggled more, but I didn't which is why I don't think it was rape, but on the other hand I was pressured into consent and when I tried to take it back I was denied. Either way it was statutory, he was a week past his 16th (age of consent in my state) and I was a week from my 15th, so still 14. 

A few hours after that a friend died of cancer, she was 16, her birthday was in April. A few hours after her one of my friends grandpa also passed away, all of my extended family lives pretty far away so he was like my grandpa as said friend was my ""cousin"" and most people assumed we were actually siblings. Three blows within 24 hours. As mentioned, my birthday was the next week, it was spent at both funerals. The following week was Valentine's day, supposed to be our 6 month. He broke up with me on February 12, and was dating one of my friends within the week. 

Right after I had gone through the shock of two deaths, the illness was getting way worse, I was at my lowest weight - 84. NOT healthy for a 5'4 15f. I genuinely felt I was going to die, if not throwing up, then chronic migraines and worrying fevers. Anyway, fast forward to February-July. Almost everytime I sleep I see one of the three events and wake up sweating and crying when it's really cold in my room and I sleep with no blankets. 

Whenever me and my boyfriend are talking and he makes a sexual innuendo as even a joke I get really bad flashbacks to that one night and other events like when he'd grope me on the bus when I'd tell him stop he'd just tell me to shush or cover my mouth. I know I was more of just a number to him, but it was nice to have some attention as my relationship prior to that was extremely physically abusive and I have lots of pictures of bruises from that one, and he also would sexually assault me, though I'd fight back and he'd threaten my little sister or smack me so I'd stop which is why I think I didn't fight the guy after him either. So yeah, the flashbacks can send me through whirls of sadness, anger, etc. And get triggered by sounds, scents, etc. Like they make it hard to breathe or move or anything and it's like I have to relive it every time and I just want it to stop. I just want everything to stop.

It feels a little better to kind of vent it all out though some of my friends say I should be over it by now. But I'm still not sure if it is PTSD or if it's normal or anything.

I'm a teenager, and I have a couple of problems.


So, first things first. Me and my mother don't have a good relationship. We clash and she very, VERY obviously favours my younger sibling to me. She vents all of her stress into me and in return, this has started to take a toll on me. It's not extreme abuse or anything, it's just terrible wording and the constant complaining/nagging at me for minimalistic things, getting mad at me for making a glass of water but not my sister (even though she never asked for one), telling me I cannot be stressed and other things that I personally find quite harmful. I don't even see her as a mother figure anymore, I feel much safer and much more comfortable around my grandmother. As far as I'm concerned? She's my mother. 

Over the past year or so I think I've been getting worse. I very obviously have a stress issue (which my family denies by telling me I have nothing to be stressed about aka “get over it), the smallest things irritate me. I have breakdowns where I'll sit and sob, particularly after my mother has gotten stressed/mad at me, but quickly get over them within 10 minutes or so. I struggle to sleep and I have what I can only describe as social anxiety (that might not be it but that's the best way I can describe it). I'm extremely forgetful, I move backwards and forwards from my mothers place and my grandmothers and I keep leaving behind small things like chargers or wires (for my Xbox). This is another thing my mother gets stressed at me over and tells me that it's my fault and I have to deal with it, despite my grandmother offering to bring it, she lives less than 5 minutes away. I also struggle to find motivation to get out of bed, do school work, ect. I also struggle to concentrate on multiple things and can only really focus on 2 things at once when I'm playing video games/listening to music (quite honestly the only escapes I have). 

I think I need help. A therapist or even a person at school to speak to. But as I've said before, I have what can only be described as social anxiety and I break down when trying to talk about any of this. I've also had a bad experience with therapists in the past (TW: slight self harm) related to me scratching my arms when I was frustrated which has lead to me not trusting them. I also can't really talk about my actual feelings to my grandmother or mother, they've told me I can't feel stress before and I'm afraid they'd either exaggerate it or simply push it aside. 

I'm struggling, and I'm only quite young. I don't want this to get worse but I don't want help. What do I do? And is there a name to what I'm currently experiencing (regarding my forgetfulness, stress and breakdowns)?

My partners sister rang her and was talking about how she was thinking about changing careers to a job I always thought might be a backup for me and she's in no way qualified or experienced but still talking to them and may well do a short course and get a job and it made me realise that I'm putting all my energy into academia not only because I do genuinely enjoy learning but because I can do it from home and my anxiety is so bad I have been unable to hold down a job for over two years now. 

This is confounded by the fact that I'm in the process of being diagnosed with epilepsy and haven't been allowed to drive and also that I've been recovering from anorexia (after ten years) but honestly it's not these things that really hold me back it's my anxiety and it's so bad that I can't be around people too long, I can't sleep at someone else's house and I can't have anyone sleep at ours, I can't catch up with people without my partner and when we do I am highly anxious and the activities have to be short, not involve food, and have a way for me to quickly get away. 

Antidepressants have never worked for me. I buy the self help books, see my psych, do meditations, buy anxiety apps, try to exercise more etc etc. 
I'm still afraid of life. I don't know how to fix it. My life would be substantially better if I wasn't so anxious and could socialise and connect with people, leave the house to pursue hobbies without a safe person (I love photography and videography), and work a job that would allow me to feel like a functioning contributing member of society (literally any job). 
My partner tries to reassure me that I do very well at uni but none of that means anything. At the rate I'm going I just see myself being someone with a lot of knowledge with no ability to apply it in any meaningful way. 

I'm so tired of living my life this way it makes me feel suicidal often. I'm just sitting on the outskirts watching opportunities pass me by and I'm getting older and no closer to being free.",-3,-7.049450549,-4.027472527,-30.49450549,-2.142857143
244sad,sad,"I'm 22, since I was 17 I've worked with 8 counsellors/therapists, I only enjoyed working with one of them. After 16 weeks (16 hours) I was discharged, the company told me I'd have to get a new diagnosis to reapply and then would have to wait months and after that there would be a tiny chance I'd be able to work with the same therapist again. This was around a year ago, I haven't received any treatment since.

I don't even know what to say anymore, since my girlfriend left (almost 2 years ago), I've had nothing to live for. I was very mentally ill when I was with her, I can't imagine what I put her through, but she gave me a reason to get better, I was doing it for us. I don't really know how to do things for me. 

I've been suicidal since I was around 12, I first tried when I was 16. My life has been full of betrayal, infidelity, deception. Mum cheated on dad and both my girlfriends cheated on me. Once dad was single he would ALWAYS have \~7 girlfriends, none of which knew about eachother. 

I've spent the last 4 years living in a big city but I couldn't take being alone anymore, so I'm back with my mum, temporarily. But if anything, I feel worse. Now I have people around, and still I feel completely trapped in my own mind. 

Everytime I think about the next step I think about how useless doctors have been in the past, I need to REALLY know what's wrong with me. At different times I've been diagnosed with: Depression, bipolar disorder, GAD, SAD, OCD, anorexia and CPTSD, all within the past 3 years. I don't even know what I'm trying to make better, there's just no way there's that much shit wrong with me. I have some fucking deep rooted issues and the task of finding someone that genuinely wants to make that better is too much for me now, I've been letdown too many times, I'm afraid the next time will be the end. 

I have no friends I see in real life, because I have no personality. My personality has become a collection of my various possible mental illnesses and the various things I've learned about how to treat them, I just have nothing to offer. No passion, no desire, I definitely would NOT want to be friends with me, I'm not a bad guy, I'm just fucking boring. The things I really love are video games, maths and psychology/helping other people, but they're fading really quickly.

Byron (Reckful) gave me really a lot of inspiration and hope, I could relate a lot to him. The way he was trapped in his own mind, his requirement for constant reassurance, his unquenchable desire to be around people he loves all the time. His path to recovery lit a real fire in me, it made me really determined to also get better, to be in a place where I was healthy enough to acquire those people I love and that love me back, to live a life where I have a purpose, to not perform the unthinkable act.

And now, after hearing the way Byron's friends spoke about him, how all they could really do is delay his death, how there was nothing they could do to stop it, how they all knew but knowing was worthless. I'm struggling to see another path for my life, I almost feel empowered, I feel no pain writing this because I want nothing more than to leave this plane of existence, to join Byron is his Everland.

I'm really fucking suffering from a huge amount of suicide ideation, I don't even feel sad, I just feel like it's already over. I'm not exaggerating when I say the only thing stopping me is my parents and my couple of friends, because I know these people really fucking love me and I don't want them to go through what Byron's friends are going through. 

I really need some sort of divine fucking intervention because I'mma fucking die. And even if my life is worthless I know my death will be fucking tragic for the people whose lives I am a part of. 

Please do not link me helpline numbers, they are all objectively dogshit help resources for me. I want to go to A&E again, but I'm not emotional enough for them to take me seriously, I'm dead inside. Last time I don't think they would've taken me seriously if I didn't have fresh cuts everywhere. I'm not really sure where to take myself anymore, my mum doesn't understand mental health and my dad is very far away, and has dealt with far too much of my shit for far too long.

245sad,sad,"i often feel like i'm some insignificant person, and i know thats such a “boohoo my life sucks” kind of thing to say, but i genuinely feel sometimes i could disappear, be removed from everyone i know's memories, and their life would not change. dare i say, it might honestly improve their quality of life. 

i know i have self esteem issues, i find it almost impossible to accept compliments a lot of the time. don't get me wrong. hearing someone compliment me makes me so happy. “they thought positively of me. f* yeah.” but in my heart and head i sincerely can't accept the compliment. i don't believe what they say at all. “thank you”s are easy for me to accept. it means i did something that made the other person happy. i'm ok with that. 

even if my close friend tells me i'm a good person, i laugh it off. i say “nah”. one of my close friends told me she actually looked up to me and i was really surprised. not even like pleasantly, i was just “what? lol why?” kind of. even when my bf told me i was cute, some part of me said, “he's just saying that because he's with you. don't even think that he means 1% of what he just said”. 

it even affects my work too, in hindsight, now that i think about it. i really want to ask for a raise, but why should my boss grant me that? it's not like my work is amazing or anything. she doesn't owe me shit.

246sad,sad,"So here's a little backstory on me:
I'm a 16 year old guy. I'm pretty introverted (like 60-70% introverted), I've had pretty bad anxiety my entire life (socially and generally). I also have depression. I'm pretty sure I have ADHD and OCD as well. It's hard for me to make friends, but even harder for me to keep the ones I make. I've never had a girlfriend. I'm interested in things that a lot of people aren't exactly interested in (activism and filmmaking, for example). I come from a close family, but a lot of the time I feel like an outsider. I also feel self conscious about my body, my personality, and pretty much everything about myself a lot of the time.

So here's my problem: I feel like I'm sinking, as you can read from the title. I feel like things will never be good for me. I feel like I'll always have feelings of strongly disliking myself. I feel like I'll never have long-lasting, strong friendships, or a girlfriend. I, a lot of the time, feel like nobody likes me and that people are only nice to me out of pity. I feel like nobody values what I have to say. There's definitely more to all of this, but that's everything that I have off the top of my head without making this post too lengthy. I, as you can obviously tell, need advice on how to feel better.

By the way, I do have a therapist for those who are wondering. I've been seeing him for about 3 years.",-1,10.52105263,-0.75,-2.5,-12.23684211
247sad,sad,"Honestly, like many people on here, I've just been having a very hard time lately. I can't shake the feeling that everything I hold close to my heart is being ripped away one by one. I was facing some anxiety and depression before coronavirus was even a thing, feeling pretty hopeless and all but my boyfriend was really supportive and reminded me I'm not broken and helped me find a therapist through our school. My life literally seemed perfect on paper like loving family, great school, good GPA, awesome relationship, financially stable, but I was still so sad and I couldn't help it.

And then once corona hit and I had to move back home and my boyfriend and I became long distance it's like everything external started to go downhill too. My pet of 10 years passed away, my dad lost his job, my boyfriend broke up with me, and now it seems like you name it, everything I start looking forward to gets screwed up somehow. 

My parents are really worried for me and make me send them pictures of me eating to prove that I ate since I've lost a ton of weight, and they witnessed one of my panic attacks just last week, but I've been having them for a while. My boyfriend and I ended well at first but I was really sad because I loved him so much and he wasn't sad at all... and I just got so unexplainably mad at him for that. I feel like my depression ruined our relationship because I would have episodes and try to talk to him about all the ways my brain was sabotaging me and he just couldn't understand and had to leave. And that's a sucky sucky feeling because he was one of the only people who was really supporting me, and when I got angry I went off on him and I feel like I ruined that friendship as well and he's just going to think I'm crazy.

Lately I've had weird thoughts around suicide. Mostly this: I feel like my entire problem for all my life has been this obsessive need to please other people. And for that reason I literally could not kill myself. I couldn't stand bringing pain to my family like that, and I couldn't stand people thinking I was selfish that I had everything so perfect and still couldn't push through life, and I've grown up religious so obviously suicide has some bad stigma around it there. And even though it might seem like a good thing that I can't kill myself, it almost makes me feel more helpless. Because if I knew I could just end things and life could have no more struggles then at least i have that control over my life, but instead it's like I'm letting everyone else control it and physically cannot take my life into my own hands, not to mention that now it seems like that easy out isn't possible and I'm going to HAVE to do life the hard way. Just feels very hopeless. 

I know that's probably a bad thought to have and I've been trying to find a therapist around my home but since I'm working 40 hours a week and now my dad lost his job and we can't afford anything expensive, it seems so impossible. 

Idk, it just sucks that I have these thoughts because I feel like depression will be so much baggage in whatever relationship I have from now on since it already made this very supportive guy that I loved so so much run away. And even though there shouldn't be, there's just such a stigma behind mental health problems and I'm afraid no one's gonna wanna marry “depressed girl who has to post her suicidal thoughts on reddit because she doesn't have anyone else who will understand”

248sad,sad,"Hi. I just need to vent as I can't in to see my psychologist as it's the middle of the night and I can't talk to my family. 

So, tonight at around 9:30, I was on my way to dropping a friend home when we came across a car that had hopped a round a bout and two cars with hazard lights on. I being a trained first aid personnel pulled over to check if everything was okay. Lucky I did because no one else on scene was first aid trained. Unfortunately the driver who had jumped the curb had apparently not remembered doing this and their head was hurting quite bad. I remained calm and I communicated with the people on site, told her to not move or get out of her car as there was no sign of danger, and called the ambos. 

I relayed all the information to them while having someone keep her calm. We were close to the police stations anyway, a one minute drive, so a cop turned up in about three minutes after the call. The ambos then arrived with two more cop cars. We gave them all the information we knew and was told by the ambos and coppas that I did everything exactly to how it should be done, that my first aid training had paid off and I executed it perfectly. 

I dropped my friend off, and talked to her parents about what had happened and why we were late. I told her and her parents to watch herself for the next few days and to talk to someone if they need to. After dropping my friend off, the shock of everything started to hit me. I called my young adults pastor and just told him what had happened (as we had just left from a young adults event) and that we both were safe. 

Now that I am home, I can't stop thinking about the accident. I know I did everything correctly, but I feel terrible still, like I'm guilty somehow. I'm all fidgety, anxious, been having spouts of panic, small crying episodes, dizzy, faint when standing, and my movements are all jerky. I keep seeing the flashing lights of blue and red cop cars and ambulances. 

I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and RAD (reactive attachment disorder) in the past two months and my depression and anxiety had mostly cleared up with the help of therapy. But now I don't know what to do. From tomorrow I will be living out of home and I'm supposed to be helping the rest of my family move out of the house tomorrow. I can't sleep. I take melatonin for my sleep anyway but even though I feel tired I can't sleep.

The reason I feel like I'm at such a loss is because I was totally miserable my entire senior year, and after a lot of talking it out and through some perseverance I finally left what was the darkest place I've ever been in, lost 25kg, got accepted into University, made a bit of money with my investments, but ever since I just feel like I can't get as good of a mental handle on things like I used to.
Not to sound conceited but I've always had naturally good reflexes and a knack for being quick on the uptake and I've noticed that I'm not just slower, but I'm straight up not reacting to things anymore, from simple things like catching an item that I'd dropped, to way more severe things like not reacting at all to the fact my car hydroplaned and I crashed off the road with my best friend in the car (Both OK luckily,[minor crash](http://imgur.com/a/NMOkH2N), write off sadly). And it f*cked me up, half a cars length away from killing either myself or my best mate and that's when this shitty cloudy, dissociative feeling started setting in worse each day.

And it's just starting to make me feel like something broke in me and there's a serious underlying issue. I'm not even sure how I'd approach a professional on this either, I just feel defeated and really dont want to get stuck in the spiral again but the more I feel like I've dissociated the worse I feel, it's like I'm losing touch with myself.

I'm sorry, I don't want to post a story that's upsetting but I'm in need of support. 

A couple of days ago, I saw some horrifying things and I don't know how to cope. I live in Texas. 

I live in a high rise apartment building. I woke up around 8:30am and got up to walk my dog. As I'm exiting the elevator in the lobby, I noticed about 4 cop cars roll up. I walked outside and I could tell something bad was going on. I could see a group of people gathered about 4 yards from me and I just couldn't stop thinking “please don't let this be what I think it is”. I quickly walked my dog and as I headed back inside, I saw a body with about 5 people around it trying to resuscitate it to no avail. 

About 2 minutes after I got back home, the police knocked on my door and had about 10 officers scour my apartment and question me after they told me they were looking for the balcony from which “an individual jumped”. After that, they knocked on my neighbor's door and nobody answered. They had to break in with guns in their hands. Though I knew my neighbors were out of town, it was still very unnerving. 

I decided to go out an hour long walk to calm down. I cried, I tried to process. For context, I had a family member commit suicide when I was younger, so this topic hits really close to home. When I walked back, I figured the body might have been moved or at least covered. It was not. He was just there, uncovered, with no one around him. Dozens of cops were in the lobby. I was angry and confused and so much more. He was there for hours. 

I recognize what I'm going through is NOWHERE near what this man and his loved ones had and have been going through. What I saw, however, was horrible. I have GAD and this has drudged up some really shitty memories and feelings. I'm not depressed nor am I thinking about hurting myself or anybody, I just don't know how to cope. What's a healthy way to process something like this?

I've really struggled with my mental health primarily in the last two to three years.

# Background

*The Beginning:*

I had utilized my university counseling resources before but there was a limited number of sessions you could go to (which meant I wasn't able to go as consistently as I needed), and the therapist that helped me the most, was no longer there. I had tried other people through the university but they weren't able to help me, which made me feel more helpless, so I stopped trying to find another counselor. (I probably haven't been to therapy in at least 1 year).

*More recently (ish):*

At the beginning of this year, I got health insurance for the first time in a few years, under my parent. I also experienced one of the worst mental health lows for me, so I decided to take advantage of the health insurance, and finally get a professional opinion on what my diagnosis could be, so I could get better. My previous university counselor/ therapist thought it was Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I had suspected I suffered depression also (ran on paternal side of family). I found a psychologist that was in my insurance network and decided to make an appointment. (I thought psychologists could diagnose AND prescribe medicine, which I was looking for since I was at my end and just wanted to try every solution, not discounting medicine as I had in the past). Over 2 or 3 sessions, I received my report and was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and severe ADHD. My report was mainly about ADHD, as that was his specialty but I couldn't care less. I wanted help with my depression and anxiety more than anything. I went to a primary care doctor to hopefully receive medicine, since a psychiatrist was going to take longer. I was prescribed with generic zoloft and oh WOW! this was amazing for me. I hadn't felt close to my 'normal' self like this in YEARS. With my mental health issues in these last years, I've been known to be an EXTREMELY sensitive and emotional person... Even the mention of a topic of any of my stressors would be cause for an immediate breakdown (for ex. ""how's school going?"" my response: immediate waterworks). Or anytime I watched something, like something slightly happy happening to a stranger, or someone slightly talking about a past issue they had, I would just start crying. I'm an extremely empathetic person too which sucks cause I feel everything to my core. Anyway, this medicine helped me not be so highly reactive which I enjoyed!

*Present Day (resource journey):*

I am highly in support of therapy and medication, at least for me. Unfortunately even with the medication in the recent months, I am still struggling. My insurance apparently had not been policy yet so my psychologist and doctor visits had billed me personally and I pretty much owe about $4000. With the pandemic going on and other circumstances, I've basically had zero income coming in this year, so this has been an extreme stressor for me also. So with this being said, i don't have access to any professional help because i cannot financially afford any more, since I'm still in the $4000 medical debt (plus other debt but that's beside the point). I have 4 pills left of my medicine and I cannot ask for another refill, as my physician wanted to see me for an appointment again before she refilled. (Again, cannot do this as I cannot afford a doctors visit). I have about 2-3 weeks of a generic prozac that i first started with but ended up not using, as we switched me to the generic zoloft. i'll probably take these until they finish because I feel like something is better than nothing.

*Present Day (emotions, coping, etc.):*

I think I mentioned it prior but my coping mechanism is avoidance. So for MONTHS now, I haven't spoken to *any* of my friends. The messages come in but I ignore them because I don't want to put any of this on this. I think a lot of the answers to this question is to reach out to my friends and I know I need to because they're really starting to worry about me but I don't want to be like ""hey sorry i've been ignoring you for 28392243 days but I've been depressed and here are all my issues."" It's overwhelming for me to handle all of this so I cannot even imagine giving them this information to handle, especially with all of the awful events that have happened this year. Basically there has been a lot of sadness and struggle for everyone this year and adding my issues to their list is not something I want to do. I have a long distance bf who I talk to quite a bit but not about these issues largely, as he's not someone who handles serious issues or whatever well. Also no one in my family knows about any of my issues because my family and I don't talk about things. So basically I don't really talk to anyone lol :/

&#x200B;

# Conclusion (kinda):

Anyway, I'm sorry if this is so long. I tend to over explain myself but also feel like I left a lot of holes in this story, and I tried to organize it so that it was easier to follow but I probably made it more difficult but hopefully someone is able to follow along slightly.

I need help. I do want to say that I have not ever experienced suicidal tendencies, which I am thankful for, so that's nothing I have to worry about right now. But I've been failing at every aspect in my life for so long now and it's extremely overwhelming for me to handle. Therapy and medication have been the BEST solutions for me in this journey but I don't have the financial means to seek these resources right now. What can I do?

263sad,sad,For a couple months or so I've been feeling weird. I feel incredibly sad sometimes and I feel like my body is in so much pain. I feel scared and lonely. I feel like I'm doing this alone. I have loving friends and family but I feel like I can't talk to anyone. It's 3am and I just finished crying in the bathroom. I have small thoughts of suicide but it's something I'll never do even if I really want to. But if there'd be a way to erase myself from existence without hurting anybody I would. Sometimes I start breathing really fast and my face and limbs go numb and I get dizzy. But I don't get why I feel sad sometimes. It's just sometimes I feel so happy. Especially when I'm listening to music or being with my family. Today we all watched the fireworks from our window and it was pretty cool. I'm an extrovert and I love being with people. I just don't know if what I'm feeling is just in my head. Because there are points where I feel like giving up but then sometimes I feel okay and happy.

264sad,sad,"Hi, since college days I've been struggling on my habit of binge internet everyday and it get worse on weekends. During workdays days I managed to get around 6-7 hours of sleep but on weekday sometimes I only got 5 hrs of sleep, sometimes if I'm lucky I get around 8 hours of sleep, btw I live in noisy neighborhood almost everyday construction noise are always persistent, loud edm music, hill song etc, noise mostly starts at 7am. Catching up sleep on weekends is a struggle as well.

 I tend to have a habit of binging on Netflix, memes, socmed and games even on workdays, but it gets worse when its nearing end of the workday. I dunno I tend to act like a teenager when it comes to my sleeping habit, I have not so consistent sleep schedule on weekdays I tried to get at least some 6-7 hours of sleep, I tried to sleep before 1am but anxiety always get me awake at night, thinking about work, awkward conversation, past mistakes, existential dread, self loathe. Then on weekends I struggle to follow that not so ideal sleep schedule but I end my binging on same hobbies around 2 or 3 am worst 4 am, hence fucking up my bad sleep schedule more. I tried to use apps to manage my sleep schedule/anxiety but every time I finished a course example 1 month better sleep course I tend to spiral out of control again, I tried to journal everyday but I stopped, maybe because I was in stressful week at work, to forget the struggles at work I binge on same hobbies, it's been a week now since my last journal entry. 

My sleeping pattern/habits is now affecting everything from work, to family, even friends, takes noticing I've become irrational, irritable, out of focus, snub etc, worse are poor decisions at work partly brought by the lack of sleep. Also my dark humor has intensified maybe a coping mechanism to my failures. Also I struggle to learn my attention span is now of a goldfish. What's worse is that I have to learn new things almost everyday at work, working at it where learning new things, trainings are a must to keep up with technology, I hardly learn something.

 I cringe on the quality of work I did, I felt like I'm the bad apple in the office, the weakest link, the slowest to learn or the one who couldn't follow instructions or do decent report/presenting. On health I'm now hypertensive, easily forgetting (I sometimes joke to friends that dementia has set in)

I felt dumber everyday as days passed by having this shitty sleep habit. I even struggle getting to post this on this subreddit, I dunno I feel so anxious getting help.

With whats been going on on social media and around the world such as Covid, politics, BLM and the new wave of sexual misconduct allegations, Im starting to feel disengaged? Emotionally numb? Detached? Idk what to call it but I think its affecting my real life. 

I noticed this yesterday when my sister came over and she talked about her history of being sexually assaulted. It didnt really get to me like I think it should have. My mom was in tears even though she already knew these things and I was just kinda there listening and asking questions. I felt like I should have had a stronger emotional reaction than I got. 

Ive told my friends on Discord ""Im in full Doomer mode"" kind of as a funny way of describing this cloud of hopelessness that has been following me around the last couple of months. Im hoping it'll pass but its something I started to feel concerned about after yesterday.

269sad,sad,"My lovely panic attack started today just before we got to my partner's parents house, where we were meant to be having brunch with them, his three brothers and wives/children. While I get along with his family, I am very wary of his two younger (twin)brothers, who are self-satisfied, rude, and obnoxious. They tend to expect things to go their way basically all the time. I'm not the only one to think this either. 
Anyway, in the start it was a mild attack, but then as his brother greeted us by tapping his watch (we were cooking bacon and eggs for everyone) I lost my head and had a go at him. Needless to say, I was judging myself heavily for that and it made me more anxious. 
While I was cooking, I became incredibly anxious, and could barely talk to anyone, or look at anyone because I was on the verge of years the whole time. Which was great, just as one of the younger brothers and wife announced they were having another baby. I knew this was coming, because they never organise family get togethers unless they have some other reason. But while it's a very joyous moment, I couldn't muster the false happiness that I should be feeling for them (middle of a panic attack, I'm also sick of everything they say and do being about babies, and also, my partner and I are putting off children for a little while, which makes me sad). I couldn't deal with this news and while I managed to hold it together, I also felt like a fraud with a very fake congratulations. 
I had to keep it together for another almost two hours before I could go home and fall apart. I just want to keep crying and my mind is going in circles and I can't deal with my thoughts and I don't want to keep judging myself, but wanted to vent it. 
It's so hard sometimes not to believe you're a bad person for something so small. I feel like everyone noticed my behaviour and I feel so ashamed. I'm usually much more mindful, even when I'm a little anxious, but it was just so out of my control today.

We have exponentially growing cases, and our governor and school board are inexplicably anti-science with their decision-making.

First of all, I don't have too many issues atm, even with quarantine, I've got family, friends, a home, videogames to play, anime, movies etc...

What I'm really worried is about my future, my goal in life, my ""purpose"". I feel like I've wasted too many years in university trying to find a good career. After 4 years of nothing, I decided to study Radiology in a private school.

Fast forward, I study and go to medical practices and suddenly, I messed up a few times. (Wont go that much into details, but it costed the hospital some money) It's because of my weak and shy personality that I end up getting behind the rest of my classmates.
I could have graduated 2 years ago. It's just that I had...a breaking point, and got really depressive. It got worst last year, so I went to a specialist to talk about my insecurities, until she ignored my messages.

I can't be sincere with my family. Even though it's only my parents and older brother (who turned 30 two days ago!).
I would be putting too much pressure on them.

The thing is, I didn't do anything remarkable in quarantine. And next week I probably have to do my final thesis which I know it'll suck because of this way I'm feeling. 

Yes, I'm considering suicide, at my 26 years of life . Or rather, I'm feeling suicidal because I fucking hate myself. Of what a pathetic and hollow person I've become.

Earlier this year, I tried to end it all, even wrote here on Reddit on r/depression on another account, on how even after all, I was feeling better. And I've got to talk to some good people, but guess that! I never logged again, end up making the same mistakes and feeling guilty for ghosting them.

I don't...know why I changed that much. I used to be a happy girl. Now the idea I can be happy seems distant. And it really scares me.

I want to stop feeling guilty for every little thing that I do. I want to try and love myself! That's why...atleast I wanted to vent here a bit.

Even though I don't have any severe traumas or any dark past, no one should feel alone, or worthless.

Next week it's going to be decisive for me. I still need to study...

I know that my story is not that urgent.  I hope other users get the support they deserve. I guess I'll just stick here for a while.

I'm currently in college but have been on summer break. I haven't even done much this summer due to quarantine (among other things) and despite all that's been happening, I feel like everyone around me has somehow managed to make good use of their time while I've sat in my bedroom depressed for most of the summer. 

College itself has just been one gigantic mistake for me tbh. I've always been book smart so academics was never a big problem, but I'm struggling with everything else that comes with college. My parents and family always insisted I go to college because working minimum wage isn't really viable and at the time it sounded like a good idea and if I could handle the academic side I figured I could handle everything else but boy was I wrong.

My parents have never really been that involved in my school life besides occasionally signing off a permission slip or whatever else I needed, which basically means I've been in charge of handling the school side of things for as long as I can remember. They've never even checked my grades. But now I'm realizing that I really wish they'd been more involved to help me make decisions cause I'm young and I keep fucking up every decision I make. 

My fam has never been to college (except my gma but that was so long ago) so they didn't help me with SATs, ACTs, and choosing a college at all because they said they didn't know much about how it works (which is a shit defense might i add because how is a 17 yr old gonna know much either when this is their first time doing all this too).

I ended up choosing a hella expensive college without thinking much about it. I figured I'd just pull out some student loans since my piss poor family wouldn't be able to afford it and the school had already given me a scholarship so at the time it didn't seem like that big of a deal. Plus, my best friend was going to the same school which was a big win for me since I wouldn't have to worry about finding a roommate. 

The icing on the cake is that i have pretty bad social anxiety. It's gotten WAYYY better since high school mostly because I started going to therapy for junior and senior year to work on my anxiety and depression (i had already attempted suicide back when I was 15), but it's still pretty bad. Everything I do is dictated around what my friends do because I struggle to do things on my own. Phone calls are my literal worst nightmare and even though I'm almost 20 my mom still makes a lot of my important calls. Trying to find an internship is nearly impossible because I'm too afraid to even reach out to people so I already feel like i'm lagging behind my peers in that aspect. The only reason I even managed to get a job at school was because I went with my friend to the job fair and I wouldn't have even gone if she didn't go first. I've definitely managed to do some things on my own which I'm kinda proud of but I'm still too far behind everyone else for it to matter much. It's hard when everything in college is dictated by connections and social interaction.

So now, not only am I gonna be in a huge amount of debt when I get out of college, but there's no guarantee I'll get a good job because I struggle too much to even make good connections and land interviews. 

I know it isn't good but all I do is constantly compare myself to my friends and classmates and think about what they must think of me. When they hear about how little I did this summer I stress about whether they think I'm a failure or not. I wonder if they judge me for not being as good as they are and it's driving me deep into depression.

Is that my best life? 42 years of emptiness, No friends and no companionship despite trying to get out of it, loneliness is supposed to be my best life? Well screw it, I don't have any life experience worth remembering or talking about, I did everything alone, there's no point if you never have someone to share things with.

That's not a life, that's a waste. The only good memories I have are from books and movies because, for a moment, I could appreciate the characters as a friend and felt like I shared something. My best memories are with imaginary people, that's how meaningless my life has been, that's how all the advice helped me. I wished someone told me sooner that not everyone was good enough to have friends and people around and that there isn't someone for everyone. Some honesty, in short.

*New Daily Persistent Headache or* ***NDPH*** *is type of headache in which patients report chronic tension headaches or migraine almost every day and there is no specific treatment for it. It can last between several months to several years or even forever. The cause of this headache is not known yet. It can severely affect the quality of life and cause concentration problems. Very less research has been carried out related to* ***NDPH****.* 

I first started experiencing this headache when I was 14-15 years old (I'm currently 19). This headache had affected almost every part of my life, from academics to social life. I lost my ability to concentrate. I used to be a brilliant but became an average one. I couldn't think properly. I struggled with every activity that required cognitive abilities. I found it difficult to sleep at night. The headache feels like a bomb in the head that may explode anytime. Painkillers don't help. I even forget daily routine tasks. I can't even sometimes understand the simplest things. I never got a good **GPA** due to it. My hard work never gave good results. I began procrastinating because the harder I tried to memorize something or solve some complex problem, the headache just got worse.

People used to make fun of me for being dumb, having cognitive issues and unable to understand the simplest things. They said I was stupid.

I really didn't get the life I deserved because of the **STUPID** headache.

I am suffering for no fault of mine.

I've had this feeling for a few years now, but it's gotten a lot worse during this year because the world seems to be on a downhill and everything is moving into sickening direction. I daydream everyday about how I'd just put a rope to the ceiling and get a stool and just choke to death.

I'm 25-years old and I feel like I've failed in my life miserably. I'm not productive, to be fair, I haven't done anything productive ever. I've always taken the easiest route and it's no surprise that I'm unemployed and have no education and no plans for the future. I hustle things here and there, leech of my friends and siblings and collect welfare to get by. I'm from a welfare state and it's a very shameful thing to be at the bottom of a society when you're living in a welfare state. My whole family is at the bottom of the society and it's always been like this. But, I have had every possibility available for me, but still I haven't done anything with my life. I cannot use my poor upbringing and the neighborhood I came from as an excuse because the education, healthcare and etcetera are free here. I'm a failure, that's the harsh truth and there's no denying that. I've always felt dumb and now I know that to be true. I used to have optimism but it's all gone now after watching these years just pass by and nothing changing. I've tried but never enough, I'm not capable enough to try enough to succeed over the ones who are naturally more talented and capable than me and have had a head start in life.

It seems like my future is written. It's either that I continue doing nothing and just use all sorts of escapism to make my life tolerable or get a low paying job which I will hate and do it for the rest of my life and live somewhat respectable life. That low paying job is behind of a lot of work for me because the employment in my country is so fucked that nobody will hire anyone who's my age and has no work experience so that option feels like too much effort for the reward. I had such big expectations when I was a little younger but the reality slapped me hard to the face and I've only realized that I'm average at best and probably below average most of the time and there's no way I can ever do anything of significance in this world. I cannot ever make my family or friends really proud which I've always wanted to. I constantly ask myself that what's the point in living if you are of no value to society and to the greater good. Sure, my family and friends may get some joy out of my existence but it doesn't change the fact that I'm an spineless excuse for a human being and that I do nothing productive.

I want a purpose in life and I want to show an example to my younger siblings so that they don't have to end up like I am now or like how most of my family have. But, what kind of purpose can dumb fucker like me have in this world? If I'd work hard, I could come your below average working class citizen, but I know that I'd hate everyday that kind of life. I'd be fine in some professions, but I feel like I'm too retarded or socially handicapped for every profession that I would actually like to do.

I'm trans and off the hormones that made me feel like a human being for the first time in my life, because my body couldn't handle it. I have broken bones in my feet and can't walk, but also can't use a wheelchair because of instability in my back that pulls my spinal cord & cuts off everything in my lower body when I sit too long.

I can't avoid getting sick because no one will wear masks here, and I will almost certainly be one of the patients who dies of it, because I have intermittent anaphylactic episodes as a result of my trash immune system even without a viral infection. I've spent so long in the healthcare system & completely alone in my studio apartment that I think I'm losing my grip on reality but really, that reality has been permanently altered for everyone in the US right now. I'm just done. I can't keep holding out for a future for myself that doesn't exist. Every single thing I do to try and get better just digs me further into the hole and there are absolutely no doctors who will help--and YES, that is a fact, thank you, because being disabled means I am inherently worth less than a healthy patient. (I do NOT believe this about anyone who's disabled but myself. This belief applies only to me. Anyone who has a disability, youre fucking amazing & doing the best you can & you deserve to feel loved & connected & human & proud of yourself. I'm just too shit even without a disability to deserve that.) Further, being invisibly disabled means I am on trial, all day, every day, and that everyone I interact with has a goddamn opinion about me. Since I'm trans soon I will not be able to get healthcare because Trump wants to murder all of us. I have no deluded hope for this election to be any less rigged than the 2016 election, and I'm waiting for my name change to go through so I can hopefully get a new passport before they stop issuing them to anyone not cis, white, or straight. I was going to be a writer & a librarian. I was going to make art that meant something & now my experience can't be used for that, because it's something no one can relate to, & instead of humanizing me, it reminds people I'm not actually a person, just a walking disease in the wrong fucking body. Even if I manage to graduate college, I'll never be able to work, & disability insurance is only available to those who've worked 5 years or more, so I'll just kill myself when I graduate. I saw this coming years ago--even got my tubes tied at 18 because I felt like there was a war on its way, & I was right. There is no fucking hope for anything anymore. I even had to go and fall for the one person who's kept me alive this long, knowing there's no way in hell it would ever be reciprocated & knowing I'm not ever really going to be seen as a man in anyone else's eyes, even though I am one.

337sad,sad,"Each time I get the thoughts they're a little more powerful and sincere. I've made no real attempts. It has mostly just been a cry for attention and validation. Pathetic and insecure outreach for someone to stroke my ego. Fishing for gems of wisdom in a sea of platitudes. Posting here is no different really. I accept full responsibility for the failure I am. All of my life's problems come from self-sabotage, laziness, and stupidity. I make impulsive decisions and hardly ever seem to learn from my mistakes. No real trauma. No real loss. Just existential dread brought on from years of poor judgment, bad psychedelic experiences, and looking at the worst of humanity through a computer screen.

Having a child did a lot for me. It gave me love like nothing I'd ever felt. It made me feel valuable. It actually got me off my ass and start taking care of myself. All of the trite bullshit you hear from every annoying parent. He is the only thing in this world that I hold dear. The thoughts would still creep in but until recently I would be able to brush them off with ease. Simply saying to myself ""That is not an option. You must be here. You must protect him. You must turn him into a man. Then you can die."" I still say this to myself but its starting to lose weight. Especially now that he is not in my life as much.

The situation with his mother is so ridiculously convoluted that I won't even try to lay it all out. Suffice it to say she took him and moved several states away. We weren't married and lived in one of the many states that favors the mother over the father. I didn't stand a chance. I had to fight tooth and nail just to be acknowledged as the father and was left with ""you can see him every other weekend and are going to start paying out the ass in child support."" Which doesn't even work logistically unless I live closer to them. I went to go stay with my father who lives about 7 hours away from them. I am currently trying to find a way to move to their state and start working there. But to say that this is an uphill battle (especially with everything else that is going on in the world) is a gross understatement.

I feel a strong need to be close to him. Because he makes me stronger. And because as much of a loser I think I am, she is worse. I genuinely fear for his future while she is the one responsible for it. But the defeat I feel from all of this is overwhelming and my drive to fight and do/be better is waning. So with all of the helplessness that I feel in this situation, the thoughts are back x1000. And they feel different than before. It doesn't feel like a fantasy I'm entertaining or something to sob to a loved one so they will tell me what a good person I am.

I was on my phone today, just checking steam when i got a notification from someone that wanted to friend me. I quickly checked my profile and i saw a new badge. Apparently, the same person that added me, gave me that badge for a review i made on TF2. 

We talked about video games, weird things and other stuff like that. He just returned to his computer and asked if i still played TF2. I said yes. He asked me if i wanted some items. I was really happy, but didn't know how to respond, because i thought what he was going to give me was very expensive and didn't want him to lose money, but i eventually said yes. 

He then asked if i had Gmod. I don't have that game either. He said he could gift it to me. I was like ""are you crazy?"". I asked if i could recompensate him for it and he said he didn't want anything in return. I was shocked because things like this never happened to me before. 

He asked if i wanted Gmod or money. I had money, but not enough for Gmod and i didn't have enough money, so i asked for Gmod.

I thought it was just a joke at first, but then a new e-mail went to me. It said that person send me the game. I was like ""WHAT?!"" I never thought this would happen.

Enter awesome kid (AK). he was about 8 years old, and had just seen me get out of the lake. the encounter went as follows:

AK: can you go swimming in the lake?
Me: yeah, the water is nice.
AK: is it against the rules?
me: no, nobody will come tell you off for swimming.

This kids face absolutely lights up when he realises that no park ranger is gonna be mad if he has a swim. so he runs off, takes off his shirt and shoes and runs into the lake at full speed.
My BF and I assumed that he had asked his parents if it was ok for him to go for a swim, regardless he was having the absolute time of his life whilst having a chat to me and BF.

Enter mum.

AK: those people said it was ok!
mum: THEYRE NOT YOUR PARENTS AK! come out now!

24happy,happy,"A little over 2.5 years ago I adopted our first dog, Kiedis, (think Anthony Kiedis of RHCP) a 2 year old Siberian Husky into my family of a 16, 4 and 6 year old boys. This was the youngest boys (4 and 6) first real experience with dogs. As such, they were a bit rough with Kiedis at first. They figured this horse-sized dog was a playmate. It was constant correction from me and frustration on the poor Kiedis. Eventually the boys learned to rough and tumble with one another and be gentle with the dog. Fast forward a few months later and we adopted another dog to help ease our naturally anxious Husky while we were not at home during the day. We invited Sirius into our lives, a 10 year old Cairn Terrier. Well, my youngest decides to pull an “Elmira” and was constantly trying to hug and pick up and squeeze our old boy, Sirius. It was back to constant correction. Until one day....
I would usually say “Don't do that! He/they doesn't/do not like it! He's/They're getting mad and may bite” My son would retort, “How do you know?” I would say, “Because dogs don't like that”. It wasn't working or clicking in his little mind. 
So one day after the 1,742,346th time of telling him to stop with the dogs and the same argument, “How do you know?”, I responded, “He told me”. This caught his attention. He said, “What did he say?” I then said something to the effect of “Get off me. You're annoying!”. This brought instant amazement to my 4.5 year old and 6.5 year old that I could understand “doggie speak”. This evolved and I became a doggie translator. 
The dogs now have their own voices. My 19 year old got on board and also does the voices. Because Sirius is a Cairn Terrier, he naturally has a Scottish accent. Mind you, my imitation of a Scottish accent is terrible. And now whenever I use the “Sirius voice”, he comes a runnin because he has associated it with himself. Kiedis has a derpy man voice. I'm a woman so my low voice is atrocious. 
Even now that my boys are 6 and 8, they will attest that I can speak dog and translate with accuracy. 

Side note: Sirius has been known to swear, much to the amusement of the boys, which is his right as a 84 year old man in human years to his 12.5 doggie years. 
He also has a tragic back story that my 19 year old and I developed in jest. We adopted Sirius at 10 years old and don't know much of his history. So we made it up lmao. 

My boys just got a new puppy at their Dad's house and I fear our long ruse of being doggie translators will be up soon.  I know their Dad will not use the same flair for imagination as we do in our house. Ah well, it was good while it lasted! And who knows, the boys might play along since it's so fun. This has taken a life of its own now. My 19 year old and I do the voices even when the boys are with their Dad.",1,-2.340909091,-3.290169133,0,-1.022727273
25happy,happy,"I've been looking at my mementos from teaching and thought of this.

For a number of years, I taught in central Japan as an English teacher.  It was a lot of fun and some of the best years of my life.  One particular class I had was a bunch (7-8 I believe) of boisterous 5-6 year-old girls.  My height shocked them initially (I'm about 6'3"") but the defining moment was during a class.  There was a fly buzzing around the room and like most kids, they were easily distracted, so my hand shot out and I managed to snatch it out of the air (before releasing it outside).  This act cemented me as the most fearsome woman they had ever met but also green-lit that they could be a bit rougher with me.  They're a great class, if a little crazy at times.

Months later, I ended up getting an injection in my shoulder.  Not a big deal but the attending nurse wasn't exactly careful so my shoulder was pretty tender.  While kneeling during one of our many games, one of the girls excitedly shakes my arm.  The resulting wince and slight gasp brought the game to a screeching halt.  Within a second, they've gathered around.  One student lifts my sleeve and realizes (with a bit of pantomiming) that I had gotten a shot.  Youngest & Sweetest student dashes to the window, banging on it to get the attention of her mother, saying that she has to come in and kiss my shoulder because I was hurt.  The #1 troublemaker comes over to pat my hand comfortingly all while looking me in the eye.  ""Sensei, it's okay to cry.  Last time I went to the hospital, I got a shot too and it was very scary.

30happy,happy,"I believe this belongs here. This is a story from 2017 and is about the best birthday that I've ever had. 

Backstory: My birthday is two days before Christmas. My parents also divorced when I was 1 year old. When I was little I was allowed to have birthday parties with whomever I wanted. It was usually family with a few exceptions when I had friends come over for the day. When I got older, fewer and fewer family members would want to celebrate my birthday on the day of and opted to just give me gifts on Christmas with the exception of my mom, step-dad, and my youngest sister (my mom's daughter - I have other siblings but they're on my dad's side). Because of this, I am hugely opposed to people having to share special days either with each other (unless they want to of course) or with holidays. I am of the opinion that everyone should have their own special day. So every year around November I would start seeing who would want to do something for my birthday. My mom, step-dad, and sister were always among those who would and then I would bring whatever friends were willing to join me. 

In this story, ""my parents"" will refer to my mom and step-dad. 

Story: I met my current boyfriend at the end of October of 2017. He and I quickly became inseparable and he was and is my best friend. In November, my mom let me know that her, my step-dad, and sister were going to be going on vacation in December and wouldn't be back until Christmas Day and wanted me to watch their dogs. I was disappointed that she was going away but she said that it was the only time that they could get off because of payroll (she's an accountant). I agreed to watch the dogs and told my boyfriend what was going on and asked if he would want to hang out with me for my birthday. He said yes and we started thinking of fun things to do to distract me from my parents being gone. 

Come Thanksgiving, I got to meet his family for the first time. We hit it off extremely well. He had said that his grandma was rough around the edges but she and I got along great and their family was the most welcoming I had ever met. Apparently his family liked me back and they asked the next day if I'd be joining them for Christmas too. I said that I would do my absolute best to make sure that could happen. 

So the day came when my parents went on their vacation and I started puppy-sitting. My boyfriend came over and helped me as one of the pups decided that all of my yarn and stuffed animals were hers and tried to eat them. 

The day of my birthday came around and I slept in and then started debating what I would be doing that day as I'd had ideas but hadn't settled on what to do especially since I still had the pups to take care of. My boyfriend then asked if I wouldn't mind going to see his parents later that afternoon. We headed over there and I was greeted with the entire group from Thanksgiving - his parents, brother, brother's girlfriend, sister, nephew, and a little bit later the grandma. When grandma came in she was carrying a huge cake that said Happy Birthday on it. His dad made a wonderful meal and they all got me presents and sang happy birthday to me. I had only met these people one time before and they went out of their way to put together a birthday party for me. It meant the world to me and ever since I have gone out of my way to do anything and everything I can to help them out so they feel as loved as they made me feel that day.",1,8.924242424,-4.314393939,0,-8.224431818

Being the resident airhead in the group, it didnt make much of a difference than how I actually act, so I'd thought they wouldn't notice. However at lunchbreak, when I told them I was craving for chocolates out of the blue, they all bought one for me.

Well, all except my friend France (not her real name) because she didn't have enough cash. I told her it was fine and I appreciate the thought anyway.

I told her she didn't have to, that her cheering me up at school was more than enough, but she told me she knows and just wanted to give it. I thanked her and we hung out for a bit before she drove home.

I lost contact with all of my friends except for one. I had a friend named (fake name) Asher we lost touch when I moved and we had no way to stay in contact really and eventually I brushed him aside but kept him in the back of my mind and talked about him occasionally. Then after five years of no contact I start having the same memory in my dreams for a week. I was at his mom's hair salon getting a trim and layers and then we went to this really fun mall. So two nights ago I started digging around and found out where her hair salon was and went off of that. More digging and I find a place matching the town and I decided to check that one out. The pictures somewhat matched but not exactly so I went on the all knowing Facebook and looked up the place that looked like the memory. I'm looking through pics when I find a video of the place I thought excitedly ""if she goes down that hallway and there are two chairs to the left and a row of them to the right this is the place."" And sure enough that's exactly what I saw so I sent her a message with my email and name explained that I used to know her son and wanted to get back in touch. Two minutes go by and she replies that she went through his papers and was about to email my mom and after that I started talking to Asher again and playing video games together and I hope to see him sometime this summer after five long years.

Note that I don't remember this story, my mom told me this recently, so the facts might not be completely straight.

When I was 4 yrs old, I used to have this Ben 10 watch (Still have it, just broken now) because I loved the show (though the reboot is something I don't wanna talk about). I was somewhere in public, like the airport, or the park. This other kid saw my watch and walked towards me. I think he was somewhere around 4 as well. He liked Ben 10 too. He and I were talking about the watch, but the thing was, he was French. I am from Africa and am only fluent in English, but I know a handful of Arabic and Spanish. Not French.  So we were just talking to each other, not taking in a word that the other was saying. We only bonded over the watch. My mom thought that it was so cute that I was playing with some kid I didn't even know over a watch.

Well, the reason I say ex boss is because she got fired. The whole crew quit after she got fired, and I was part of that. Recently, I've been hanging out with her and her family just because there's nothing better to do. But this one night, we were so bored and had nothing to do so we decided to get drunk and high. Our mutual idea while under the influence of both was to dye our hair. Me being more messed up than her led her to do my hair for me. I have never felt such love and care in my life until she put her hands on me. I was so drunk and high and had no recognition of what was going on. But what I was fully aware of was the way she was caressing my hair. After we applied the dye, we took separate showers and cleaned up. And whenever I asked her for a blow drier for me, she offered to help me dry it. And again, the way she was so gentle with my hair felt so warm and comforting. I can't quite place words for what I felt that night. But i gave her a hug and told her she means too much to me and that I would never wish harm upon her soul.

Developmentally and speech delayed and autistic. She can be a handful. Things would be so much easier with her if she could communicate. While her communication has gotten better she's still so far behind. But this story is from when she was about 4yr old. She barely spoke, mostly just screams and babbles. God forbid you try to hug or cuddle her because she was not about the cuddling life(her autism. For a while I took it personally and thought she didn't love me). She was not a very lovey dovey kid(still isn't really). And at this point it never dawned on me that she might be autistic. Her father just kept insisting she was fine and was just being defiant. His g/f knew some ASL and had the same feeling that I did about my daughter, that she actually had problems.

To set the scene. I hadn't met my current g/f yet. I wasn't medicated. Hadn't gone to therapy. Was still married and my(at the time) husband has his side chick living with us. I was in a dark place and at the end of my rope. I crashed and hit a low point, a place I hadn't been since I was pregnant with my daughter. I was sitting on the kitchen floor holding a knife in my hand. It felt like I was sitting there forever with tears down my face quietly sobbing. Everyone was asleep. I broke down and tossed the knife on the counter unable to do it(was still alone at this point) and just curled up and cried. I looked up for a second feeling like I was being stared at and saw my daughter standing there(sneak little ninja that she is). Now she doesn't look directly at people very often and never for long periods of time when she does. But there she was just standing there staring at me with this old soulful eyes. She walked over to me and I quickly tried to clean up my face and try to stand up only to be stopped by her crawling up into my lap and curling up there. She reached up her hand around my head and pulled it down to I was resting my head on her head. I wrapped her up in my arms and just cried. She sat there in my lap holding onto me and patting the back of my head. It was at that point I realized how much she loved me and that she just has problems showing it. I told her I loved her so much. She looked down at her free hand and carefully managed to sign ""I love you"" to me. I then picked her up and took her back to bed and tucked her in.

65happy,happy,"Hi, I'm 16 and for my whole life, I never saw my father. I'm a single child and my mom and my dad got divorced before I was born. I always bring up my seeing my dad to my mom but my mom always changed the subject or said: “If he ever wanted to see you he would see you.”


My mom has her office in the basement and whenever she forgot something from downstairs, she'll have me go down and get it. One night years ago (about 2-3 years ago) she forgot something in her filing cabinet. That was when I came across the divorce papers. I started searching through to find something about my father. The only thing I could find was an address. A month later I brought it up with her and she told me that the last time she knew of him was when he was moving down to Tennessee. So I kind of lost hope when she said that. 


I got my first phone in the middle of my freshman year. I saved the address on my phone so maybe I could go to it one day. Two weeks ago, I had my license for a while and so I told my self that I was going to the address on a certain day.


I had to find some way to not tell my mom that I was going to see my dad, so I made the excuse that I was going to be hanging out with friends the whole day. I didn't know what I was getting myself into. The only information I have about my dad was from my mother, she said he was a lazy drunk who never helped around the house. Out of everything I heard about him, I still wanted to see him. I only had the address to go to, and there could be a chance he wasn't there, but I drove over an hour to that location.


Every mile I made I was thinking to myself “What am I doing?”, but I kept ongoing. I was going behind my mom's back which is something I never did. To give you a preference of how far I had to drive and the time I had to rethink everything I was doing, I live in a small town called Maineville Ohio, he lived in a small town called Verona Ohio past Dayton. That's 1 hr and 16 min of me driving at the age of 16 going to a place I don't know what to expect from behind my mom's back. 


Once I got there, I knocked on the door and his wife answered the door. She said, “Hello, is there anything I can help you with?”

“Yeah, I'm 5 Elements. Is Mr. Elements here?”

She led me inside and opened a door to where my father was sitting on a bed. I said nothing, I just started crying. He got up and gave me a hug. All I could do was give him a hug. After a while, he sat down with me He told me his side of the story. He was working every day for long hours and rarely had anytime to be with my mom. My mom was in school working to become a teacher. He told me how he only sees her once a week, and when he was there, she'll always ignore him, go out with friends or volunteer at various locations. He told me that they had similarities but yet different. He didn't want to bring me back and forth cause he didn't want to make me feel that he was only picking me up just because he had to, cause he grew up like that with his brother and two sisters. He knew that it was the best choice to leave me with my mom. That was when we both got each other's numbers so we could stay in contact. I just have to keep him a secret from my mom.


Now I'm thinking to myself, what if I never went and took my chances of seeing him. I now have a whole new side of the family I have yet to meet. If I haven't gone to that location I wouldn't have known that Diabetes runs though my family, That I'm an uncle to my halfsisters kid, and I wouldn't have known that he actually did still love me. ",1,4.029616725,-6.198606272,0,-8.93728223

I myself have this nature to try and be kind to people of course i am not angel but i felt as though i could do more for him. So I grabbed my cake pop and took a piece of paper and wrote him a note.

He became a teacher because he wanted to help kids get ahead in any way possible. He runs tutoring groups and after school activities for the high school and middle school he works at so the kids have chances to get ahead or have a safe place to study/just be. Incase home is bad or they have no where to go. And In his classes he tries to do everything possible to help all students learn and be better from doing tests in different ways to making sure everything is covered in class so kids don't have extra homework. 

Matt helped advocate for me with all the bad that's happened to me and been my biggest supporter since I was born. He sends me uplifting memes and has a bunch of nicknames for me to replace all the hurtful ones our parents gave me. He let me live with him when I was kicked out and managed to get me into therapy. 

He tries to volunteer and raise money for good causes where ever and whenever he can. Matt wants everyone to feel good about life and believes more people should have reasons to smile during the day so he tries to be that reason. He'll be the first to comfort people when they have a bad day and has been there for me on all my bad worse days reminding me that I was loved and deserving of life/happpiness.

84happy,happy," Last night I got in an accident that totaled the car I have owned for 17 years. Fortunately, I was okay. It wasn't a super high-speed collision, but I hit was an SVU with a high bumper that hit squarely into my hood. It didn't need a lot of force to do a lot of damage.

I don't usually anthropomorphize my possessions, but that car was an exception. It had a personality to me, it had a character, and it had a life.

My mom died when I was 19, and my dad got me the car only a few months later. I didn't want my mom to pass, but she was also abusive, controlling, and codependent. In a lot of ways, getting that car represented a freedom I had never had before.

I knew we were perfect for each other the day I got it. My dad wanted to get me a low tier convertible, because he thought it looked cool, but I refused. I wanted something I could afford to maintain on my own, and I wanted to attract friends that were down to earth, ones that cared about me not my car.

I also insisted on a key fob, even though those weren't standard yet. I have ADHD and had locked my keys in the hand me down truck I had driven in High School more times than I can remember. But, I knew if I needed the fob in my hand to lock the door, locking it in the keys in the car wasn't something I had to worry about any more. I also insisted on a standard transmission. I wanted a car I could really get to know, to learn what it liked and didn't like, and how to coax it into doing things even it didn't think it could.

There was only one car on the entire lot that had both those features, and it was stored in the back of the lot behind a few dozen other cars. I made them move all of those cars, just so they could get that special one for me. It was even Silver, just like I wanted.

That car was there with me all through college, which I not only had to navigate on my own with learning disabilities, I also had to build all the social skills I had missed out on in high school because of mom. But I dove headfirst into all those challenges, and that car helped carry me through.

It was also there for almost every outing with my Little when I volunteered for Big Brothers Big Sisters, which has been one of the most enduring and important relationships in my life.

That car went with me when I drove all the way to California just to see Radiohead, and drove to Chattanooga and Indiana to visit friends about a year later. It saw me through two cross country moves, and came only about a hundred miles away from seeing both coasts with me.

But it also saw the bad.

When I was in an abusive relationship for 6 or 7 years, it was a safe haven. The only space I truly had to myself. During that time, it also saw the darkest moment of my life. My ex publicly humiliated me at fastfood restaurant. Then when we were confronted by the staff, because I was the one crying and visibly upset, she played it off as if I was the one abusing her. After she drove off that night, I got in my car and pointed it at a brick wall about 50 yards away. For only a second I floored the gas, just to see how it would feel. That moment horrified me, and I got help about a week later, though it still took years to accept that my ex was abusive and leave.

That car never judged me, and it never failed to be there when needed it.

When I finally got out of that relationship, and met my first boyfriend, that car carried us all the way to Washington DC for the first Women's March. Later that year it carried us around Yellowstone, through Montana, and to Seattle in one the wildest and most amazing adventures of my life. I've lived in Seattle for around 3 years now, and I even bought a condo just a few months ago.

That car got me, and I got it. It was forgiving of the things I was bad at (like when I got a little container to be a trash can that sat right behind the passenger seat, but always let it overflow before taking it out). But I also didn't care when the interior handles for the back-seat doors started to come off if you pulled them too hard, and I made sure everything important was taken care of. When the driver side door started to creak, I gave it WD40, when the radio broke down, I just got a Bluetooth speaker to use with my phone, when the a rear door window wouldn't stay up, because I couldn't afford to replace the motor for it, I had the shop take the motor out and put in a makeshift part that just always held it closed.

I used to talk to it sometimes. Just little conversations every now and then. Whenever it broke down, I'd pat its dashboard and reassure it that it was okay, it would get fixed. And when I made the move to Seattle, I told it I knew it was getting old, that this wasn't going to be easy, but that I believed in it.

It took care of me, and I took care of it. 

At the accident last night. I was the first to get out my car, and check on the two other drivers. After that I looked back and saw how busted up it was. In so many ways, I'm at the best place in my life, and I finally feel truly safe for the first time. Staring at that car as it sat there in the rain with its hood totally caved in and radiator crushed, I realized it would never drive again. But this time instead of me talking to it, letting it know it would be okay, it stared back at me as if to say ""it's okay, you don't need me anymore. It's time to let me go""

I'm grateful I'm alive and no one was hurt in the accident. I'm also grateful that car carried me as far as it could. After the accident, everyone in my life has been supportive, but most don't really get what that car actually meant me. I knew that car longer than the dog I grew up with, and almost as long as I knew my mother. Next year, I would have known it half my life. Its awkward, but while everyone around me is understandably focused on making sure I am okay, I feel like I'm mourning one of the oldest and best friends of my life. I know I will move forward, and it's even fitting that that car came into my life when I needed it most and held on just long enough for me to get where I needed to be. But I will miss that car for the rest of my life.",1,-0.962189318,-8.324695928,0,-7.33342147

I know what you might be thinking, free $20, but I panicked a bit since it wasn't really free $20 and I had to get to the bottom of this. I messaged the support team, I wish I could screencap it but since it's a banking app Android blocks screencaps. The message was as follows.

-[Initial Message]-
Topic: More Money in my account than I thought I had

I went to bed last night and swear I only had $2, but looking at my account today it said I have $22. I know it changed and I don't see any deposits that would have added the extra $20. I'd hate to spend money that doesn't belong to me even if it's tempting to get gas with so I just want to know if this is a mistake or if a payment was declined or a deposit took a while to process or something.
I really can't find anything myself that would make this add up and as I said I rather not spend money that isn't rightfully mine. If this was a mistake, please remove the surprise money since it's not mine. If it's not, at least tell me so I can calm down. I'd like an explanation if one can be provided but it's okay if I don't get one, confirmation is good enough.

So I left the house for a bit and on the drive back I got a message myself, and reading it made me smile. I'm gonna have to redact a few things but here it is.

-[Response]-
Awhhh, you are so kind and thoughtful that this message genuinely made me smile. 

So when I take a look it appears that the Steamgames.co ### transaction for $19.99 that was initiated February 6, 2020 was cancelled. 

Sometimes, merchants just take a while to finalize on transactions and the hold for the funds can fall off making it look like the funds have credited back into the account, but the merchant can reclaim those funds at a later date. I can't tell if this transaction is from the transaction being cancelled or the merchant taking time to finalize.

If you want to be certain you can reach out to the merchant to see if it was cancelled. If not, it's safe to assume they'll pull it at a later date. 

All the best,

When they announced the day, every other student gathered up as much pink as they could and brought it for those who own nothing pink.

And when she announced she was cancer free almost a year later, we threw a party for her with baked goods and foods we all brought in.
Granted, we're only a small school in a small town, and are a bit more close knit, but we have never had this level of organization in any event in our school. We've never until that point had a moment where every single student got together for one purpose. And it was a beautiful to see that sea of pink in the hallways.

90happy,happy,"I still totally think this was a great revenge so I wanted to put this story somewhere! I'm excited and uplifted to have found this subreddit.







Alt/Throwaway account because it involves child abuse and I don't want to get anyone in trouble for how they handled things.







I guess this is more my mom's story than mine, but I was involved. It's about how I got my sister. I'll call myself Sara and my friend Alex.







Since middle school, I have been best friends with Alex. It all started with us being paired for a project, and we did great together! I struggled often in school, so my parents were so happy. So I invited her to eat lunch with my group of misfit friends. She was an outcast, too. From then on, she would help me with any schoolwork I needed, and I would help her with math. See, I wasn't born in America, and my family immigrated during a critical period in my language development, so I needed anything and everything I wrote for classes proofread and edited. Don't get me wrong, I'm pleased we moved for my mom's career- she became basically Dr. Cuddy to our small town hospital and clinic- but that sort of move isn't all roses.







Alex was great at improving my written work. Even my parents loved her, because they saw my grades go up as she helped me, and she was always respectful and quiet. A Good Influence.







We quickly became best friends, so much so that everyone at school tended to refer to us in one breath as “AlexandSara.” The only classes we ever had differently were AP English for her, regular for me, and our language classes. She took one and I took the other.







I still feel bad about not figuring out what was going on earlier. But Alex was the brainy one, not necessarily me. Sure, there were hints. I'm pretty sure it's not normal for your friend to eat half your kitchen when she comes over, or my having to sneak her breakfast and other extras. But I just thought it was a weight thing. Alex's mom was a rail thin athlete, who also thought it was important for her kids to be bilingual. It's hard to know what's going on when you don't even know a dozen words of said difficult foreign language. And we hardly ever went to Alex's house anyway.







Over a period of the first three years I knew her, Alex slowly changed. It was nearly unnoticeable unless you knew her as well as I did, but she went from talkative and happy to withdrawn and...crushed. I don't know how else to describe it. It was like cutting off oxygen to a fire. Her flame suffocated. She didn't want to go swimming or play sports any more, wore jeans and long sleeves no matter the weather, and seemed perpetually exhausted. Toward the end, I swear she was losing weight, and was as white as notebook paper. Another funny thing was that she *never* cried.






I, I mean we, *tried*. But every time, Alex would insist everything was fine, no matter who or how asked her. Eventually I dropped the subject. I could tell she was getting annoyed with me.






One late winter day, it was weirdly warm. It's cold where we lived then, so of course we went for a walk. The sunset bathed everything in red. We were out so long that it was nearly dark when we stumbled back.






Alex tripped or something. Partially melted ice is the worst, and it was right at the foot of the neighbors' gravel driveway. Before I got there, she was already staggering to her feet again, so it can't have been that bad.






“I just cleaned, so take off your shoes at- Alex, you're bleeding,” my mom called, abruptly switching tack mid sentence, as we dragged mud inside.






“I'm okay. I just fell down in some gravel.” But one knee looked ruined, and there was a big scrape just above her elbow, already bleeding through the shirt.






“Let me-” mom insisted.






“*No!* I mean, no thank you.”






I caught a note of panic in Alex's voice. Alex never panicked. Why now, over something so minor?






“Don't be stupid. You might have some pieces of gravel embedded where you fell.” Alex flinched at the use of “stupid,” but she was four foot eleven and a hundred pounds if that at the time. No contest. My family's unusually tall. It wasn't hard for my mom and I to steer her, limping badly, into the kitchen.






I knew the routine from my mom treating a million childhood bumps and bruises, and went to get the massive first aid kit from the bathroom.







“Alex, hold still so I can-“ Then thirty seconds of the loudest silence I ever heard, just broken by the tap running, greeted me as I came back in.







“Sara, put it on the table. Alex, *breathe*. You're panicking,” my mom finally said. Then I saw what made my friend finally lose her cool.







The parts of her arm not scraped raw were covered in a web of scars, some old, some fresh.






“Why didn't you tell me?” I blurted out.







My mom told me sharply in our language to be quiet if I couldn't help, told Alex it was okay, she wasn't mad, we'll discuss this after we finish patching you up. There were more scars on Alex's legs, too.






Eventually, with lots of stopping and starting because she was crying so hard, we found out that Alex had been hurting herself for almost three years. She was always anxious. Everything had to be perfect for her mom. Even admitted, in a roundabout way, that said mom told her really cruel things, called her names, and didn't like to give her enough to eat. Think Amy Chua with a food complex.







And of course, my mom had to tell her, hey, I'm going to tell whichever of your parents comes to pick you up tomorrow about this. So you can get help. “Better you than me. They'll kill- I mean, be so angry then,” Alex, looking resigned, said.







I woke up to a raging argument the next morning. Couldn't be my dad or brother- dad was abroad, brother already in college. No, this was a catfight. I went over to where Alex was sleeping and covered her ears. This was nasty. I told her she really didn't want to hear it. But I didn't have four hands, so I heard it all. I recognized her mom's voice. No, I won't get her any help, she's lying. Just being dramatic. Don't listen to her. Don't tell me how to parent.







Finally, my mom asked point-blank whether Alex's mom would be pursuing any kind of treatment for her kid. Mommy Dearest said no, I get to choose medical care for my own kid, she's only sixteen.






What happened next would have knocked me over if I hadn't already been sitting down. I strained my ears and just caught, “...you're right. It is your choice. But, I'm a mandated reporter due to my job, and you've just admitted you're going to neglect your child's serious medical problem. I put a tape recorder somewhere for this talk in case things got ugly. It would be a shame if someone reported you to CPS with evidence, you being a teacher and community figure…”







I jumped about eight feet in the air when Alex's mom yelled back, “Are you *threatening* me?”







“Not at all, Mrs. X,” my mom said calmly. “What I'm saying is that if *you* don't help Alex, *I* will. My family has grown to love her and we don't want anything to happen. I have a form here that would allow me to make medical decisions for her, just temporarily. Sign it, leave her with us, and I won't report you to CPS.”







There was more arguing, but my mom had clearly shifted the balance of power her way. I don't know exactly how she did it, but she got the signature, and we kept Alex. I was so happy to finally, really get a sister, whatever the circumstances. And my dad? He had been abroad for a few weeks at that time. I can't imagine *that* conversation! Like, “I saw a stray human, can we keep her?”







And Alex got better. I mean, at first there were a lot of arguments. It was like pulling the pin on a grenade. Once she couldn't cut, Alex had no idea how to handle herself! I mean, she barely slept! I was sure she was going to get the boot- if I'd said those things-, but my mom is my hero, and the calmest person I know. Then I had a huge shock- my perpetually strong friend cried for weeks on end. Well, at least it wasn't cursing or yelling.






After things were a little calmer (which took a few months), my parents, Alex's parents, a mediator, and Alex's stockbroker uncle all sat down together. See, Alex's uncle had an education fund he was tending for her, and he was appalled to learn of his sister in law's conduct.






By then, she was seventeen. It wasn't too hard to pull the funds a year early and use them to pay for Alex's portion of the family insurance premium, since they were furious about continuing to pay it. In return, her parents signed a temporary guardianship form. This extended my mom's authority past medical decisions- it's essentially the same form that lets host families of exchange students act as parents- into all major aspects, and let her sign forms as Alex's guardian, so she could go on field trips again. There was even enough money, if she was careful, to put Alex through all of college and provide her with a small personal allowance until she graduated. Not that my parents couldn't afford another person, but Alex was big on not being a burden.






My parents and I moved when I was 22, and even though it's far away, Alex knows she can visit whenever she wants. Seeing her smiling and playing with my one year old son is really what made me think to write this story here. It's not a perfect mean or funny revenge like many I see here. 





But my revenge is having my “sister” here. Alive. She still has some problems, and can't work full time at the moment, but has a supportive spouse, a decent part time job, and volunteers at an animal rescue.

Things were still very new to them. They were still adjusting to their new home and were amazed at the simple things like eating, playing with toys that belonged to them and having nice clothes to wear.

When the Christmas tree went up, they didn't have any idea what it was. They thought it was pretty and enjoyed decorating it and looking at it but other that... no clue.

When we talked about Santa they were clueless about that as well. They couldn't believe such a thing was possible. They were four and five years old at this point and had never experienced a Christmas of any consequence.

We took them to the nice mall for a visit to Santa. They asked, ""dad... that man really brings us presents?"" Of course, I explained and told them the whole deal.

I was really bothered by the fact that they came from a  foster home and never got a single present, a tree or any of the traditions associated with it. When we picked up the girls from the foster home, the foster mom didn't give us anything except a bag of mens tube socks...no toys, dolls, nothing.

Gradually stacks of presents gathered under the tree, and on Christmas eve we put out milk and cookies for Santa.

They were very skeptical about the whole deal and were questioning the whole down the chimney thing and trying to find holes in my story.

We were listening to Christmas music and reading stories and they kept running to the front window.

I thought they were looking for Santa. Finally, I said, ""Santa won't come till later after you are asleep.""

The girls said, ""no dad we are looking for the police mans they always come get us at Christmas""

Sad.

Anyway, when the girls went to sleep I put on my big work boots stomped them around in the fireplace and left dirty boot prints on the white carpet leading to the cookies, took a bite, drank some milk, put out the Santa presents and went to sleep.

The next morning about 8AM I heard a tremendous squealing and laughing.

They dragged me downstairs to show me the footprints and the half eaten cookie. He's real! he's real!!!

I went into a dollar store one day after work just to buy junk food. I love doing that cause you usually get way more there than you would elsewhere.

At any rate, the candy section is near the cash desk and as I'm picking out my several poisons, I hear a customer being a d-bag to the cashier. I hate it when people do that. Been in customer service for years and I know how it is. You are basically defenseless for the most part when someone decided to mistreat you.

I finish picking out my junk including a strange item, a coconut key lime, two piece chocolate.

I get up to the counter and smile at the cashier. She didn't look happy. I changed that in the following manner.

Me: Hey when did you get these? (hold up the key lime coconut thingy)

Cashier: Very recently I haven't tried them. I'd like to though.

(She lightens up a bit.)

Me: Could you please leave them out of the bag? I'd like to try them right away. Thank you. (purposely being extra pleasant and polite)

She does as I asked and finishes ringing up my junk. I pay and then I do what she obviously didn't expect.

I pick up the key lime coconut thingy, open it up and offer the first piece to her. I take the second piece and we both bite in at the same time.

Me: Pretty good eh!

Cashier: (smiling) Yeah! I gotta get some before I leave work today.

Me: I sure would! You have a great day eh? (Yeah I'm Canadian)

Years ago I had a flea market booth. I sold a bit of everything, new and used. I only stopped cause the property was sold to put condos on it. I miss that place. Anyway...

I had a ton of Hot Wheels there for $1 each or buy 5 get 1 free... but I digress.

I see no sign of parents so I ask him ""Where's mom?"" and he tells me as he points in a vague direction, ""Over there."" and he continues looking at the cars.

I'm about to call one of the flea market staff over when a girl shows up and gets the kid. She couldn't have been more than 11 or 12 so not much better. 

I figure that's that, big sis came and got him and I go back to doing my thing. 

Not ten minutes later the kid is back and straight over to the cars. I start talking to him asking which car he likes best cause I figure at this point he is safer with me than he is wandering around the place. I know I'm going to keep him safe cause, well, I know me. 

So I tell him, ""Hey, take any car you like. Pick one."" He looks up at me with the biggest smile and widest eyes.

""Really?"" he can't believe it!

""Yep!"" I tell him and we continue to talk about the best car to play with. He finally picks one and his mom shows up with big sis. 

He runs up to her all excited with his free car. She barely acknowledges him, doesn't even look in my direction. Piece of work...grrrrrrrr!

Big sis runs over and says thanks and the little guy smiles and waves as they vanish never to be seen by me again. 

By now that kid is likely in his teens...if I have my timeline right. I hope his life is better than I saw that day. I hope my small action sits with him and he pays it forward.

97happy,happy,"7 or 8 years ago I saw a cute puppy sticking his head out of a house's fence. He looked really excited and playful, me and my friend petted him for a bit and I took a picture of him. 

Today I was taking the usual road to go home when I saw this dog, beautiful and quite big. He came up to me, I petted him and recognized a white spot on the top of his head. It was that puppy ! 

I'm sure it's the same dog because I saw him not even 5 meter away from the house I saw him in as a puppy, plus that mark on his head and the color of his hair are quite recognizable, also I had never seen another dog like that in the neighborhood. 

It made me happy to see that puppy from 7-8 years ago all grown up.

99happy,happy,"I have to tell this story anywhere I can because I love it so much. 

All last month I looked through all of my stuff to see if I could find anything that I would want to get rid of and I found my husband's childhood N64 with our games, including my Gold/Holographic Majora's Mask that my mom's ex-fiance gave to me and my little brother before leaving our lives.

I already have the Collector's Edition and my husband has the 3DS version so I was going to try to sell it… But I couldn't. I loved that man almost as much as I love my own dad. I couldn't sell it for extra AMKE money.

My little brother also has the Collector's Edition, but he was having financial problems. I figured that I could give it to him and he could do whatever he wanted with it. I included the game in his Christmas presents and we had this conversation:

Him: “Oh sweet! I already have this game but it's really cool to have the Gold Cart/Holographic edition!”  


Me: “I know. I'm giving it to you in case you need extra money. I couldn't bring myself to sell it. It means a lot to me but I'll be happier if you can get some use from it.” (Husband's N64 doesn't have the expansion pak. Also I was trying to get rid of things anyway.)

Him: “Wait, was it (husband's)?”

Me: “No… It was the one given to us by (mom's ex-fiance.)”

Him: “Wait what really?! Well I can't sell it *now*! I'm going to have this thing on display!”

For the record, my mom only broke up with her ex-fiance because she decided that he deserves to raise his own child. One that she wasn't willing to give him because she's already a mother of two. Not for anything bad.

And a couple years ago I was able to find him after almost twenty years later. Funnily enough, I was able to spot him because of the Zelda shirt he was wearing, and my eyes have a special ability to lock onto Zelda anything. (He's the one who got me into the series.) He was at the movie theater with his own flesh and blood son who was about five or six. He's getting his son into Ocarina Of Time the same way he got me and my brother into it. I told him about how my brother, my mom and I are doing, introduced him to my husband (then fiance) and he then said something like

“I would wonder about how you guys are doing sometimes. Now I don't have to.”  


After twenty years I still love him. Some of my favorite childhood memories involves him, and I'm really happy that he was able to have his own child, making the same memories with him as he did with us. (And more, obviously.)",1,3.215608466,-5.284391534,0,0

111happy,happy,"Old story, but since my husband is pulling a similar stunt this year as I did last year,

Background; I'm a gamer at heart, and have been since the very first Pokémon game released. I got Pokémon Red and my younger sister got Pokémon Blue. We didn't get a link cable initially, as we had to share my dad's Gameboy to play, but we were happy with them nonetheless. We continued playing Pokémon as we grew older, but my sister drifted away from gaming around Gen 3 and began to focus on other things.

Now, I didn't play Pokémon exclusively. When I was at home, I would sit down in the living room, hook up our Playstation (the original) and play Chrono Cross. My sister would sometimes sit down and watch me play the game, sometimes for hours on end, commenting on everything I did in game and sometimes roleplaying as the characters with me when I did something dumb or silly.

Before continuing, quick note; the original Playstation was region-locked (yeah, I know, dumb), but could be modded to play games from other region and… wait for it… pirated games. This was during a time when it was still hip and cool. Rest assured, I've grown over that.

When I moved out of my parents' house with my then-boyfriend-now-husband, I left most of the games that we had at my parents' house for my sister to enjoy… but I forgot to leave behind a memory card. Whoops.

Anyway, my sister didn't play on it much, because it was too much of a hassle for her to set it up. When she finally moved out, though, she had the space to set it up and began playing games on it on occasion (mostly Crash Bandicoot 2 and 3).

Now the main story;

Last year, somewhere mid-May, I believe, we were all at my parents' house for dinner, when she asked me a question.

Sis: Hey, do you still have Chrono Cross?

Me: Yeah, I do. …Why?

Now, Chrono Cross was one of the few games I had opted to take with me for two reasons.

1) it was still one of my favorite games of all time for the PS1

2) I had actually bought it officially after the pirated version we had got scratched to the point where it was no longer playable.

Sis: Well, can I borrow it?

Me: Wait… you wanna play it?

Sis: Yeah.

Me: Why? I mean, you can borrow it, sure, but why so suddenly?

Sis: Well, I took the Playstation to my apartment and as I was playing I thought ‘Hey, I've never actually *played* Chrono Cross. I've only ever watched you play it.

Me: Oh yeah, you did.

Sis: Oh! And can I also borrow your memory card? I think you took it with you.

Me: Did I not leave any? Ah, my bad. Yeah, I'll look for them so you can borrow them.

However, when I got home afterward, I had a MUCH better idea.

I went online, and found (and bought) her an actual copy of Chrono Cross plus a memory card, to gift her for Christmas. And not just a second-hand copy; no, I got her a *brand new* copy of it. So new, that the Squaresoft logo was replaced with that of Square Enix.

She did ask every so often if I'd found the game and card yet, and I would say I hadn't, but I'd try to find it ASAP. 

Finally, Christmas arrived, and we're at my parents' house. I, as usual, am handing out the presents to everyone. After a few presents between the rest of my family and husband, I gave my sister her present. Now I'd wrapped them both up in one package, with the memory card obscuring the cover of the game, so you'd see that first and would have to pull it away to see the rest.

As she pulled away the wrapping, you could see the confusion on her face as she read out loud, before shifting to realization.

 Sis: Playstation… ooooh! Memory cards! Awesome!

And then she removed it from the game case.

The second she realized what she was looking at, she gasped and – no joke – she squealed, and I laughed as she excitedly showed it off to everyone.

Me: Now you don't have to borrow it; now you have your own copy.

Living with my grandmother and uncle is hard for someone like me since I eat and drink a lot.Anyway, this particular day, I saw this homeless guy begging out the front of the supermarket asking for spare change. I know the general rule of thumb not to give a homeless person money, just in case he uses it to buy himself drugs or alcohol, and I don't carry any money with me anyway because I find it easier using my debit card. I went ahead with my business, buying myself the stuff I need/want to last me the fortnight until my next trip to the shops. Since it is almost Summer, and the recent Spring days have been really darn hot, I decided I'd buy the homeless guy a bottle of water. I grabbed a 1.75 litre bottle of spring water and bought it alongside the rest of my things.I went to the place where I saw the homeless guy and noticed the stool he was sitting on was vacant. The dude was nowhere to be seen, but then I didn't get a good look at him on my way in anyway.

He gave me a wave and said ""thanks buddy"". I'm usually a quiet person so I smiled, gave him a thumbs up, and walked away.

But during the conversation I told her something that she ended up screenshotting and sending it to me show me. I was glad it made sense to her and soon forgot about it. 

Fast forward a few months and I fell in love with my best friend. So much that I lost myself as a person. With the nature of our relationship and how close we were, I was stupid to assume I had a chance and asked her. The rejection was unexpected and shocking and completely destroyed my confidence as a guy. Everything I had held proudly to myself was being scrutinized mercilessly by my own demons and cast aside as useless or fake. I felt naked and helpless and was reduced to a person craving external validation. 

And then, one day, as I went through my phone, I saw this photo of a conversation. And for a second I felt I could really relate to what it said and was amazed by how powerful it was for me. And then, with a shock, I realised it was my very own words. Coming from a more capable and confident version of myself lost in time, those words were soothing and powerful. 

I'll just leave it here in the comments if it makes sense to someone else going through this. :)

We put the cat on the sidewalk, and another girl showed up holding a cat-sized cardboard box. We put the cat into the box and she tried contacting a vet that she knew, unfortunately without success. However, another passerby with a dog told us where to find a vet in the neighbourhood so we took the cat there. Someone else told us that the cat was a stray from the neighbourhood who had been involved in accidents in the past as well.

We brought the cat to a vet, who made a very good price for us (almost the price of a cat hotel!). It's a very calm and well-mannered female cat. Unfortunately she has a hematoma in her brain from the accident, but she's generally in a very good condition, improving day by day.

After I had found out the news, I pushed my chair onto the floor and cussed him out, I was sent to the office, and then the principle told me to go talk to our schools counselor so I could take a break and clear my head (he new i had home issues all my life and was very cool about the situation, i'm thankful for that)

I go to the counselors office, and she starts off with basic conversation. She asked what my favorite subjects are and all that, ya know, basic stuff. Then we get to talking about my home life, why i'm so angry at the world, where my negative energy was coming from.

Backstory: So I live in a small city, we see a lot of people we know every day. When I was in elementary school, I used to walk with this nice lady and her old pit bull named Harvey. We would walk until we got to my school, then we would part. We knew each other because my grandma and grandpa introduced me to this place at a library that holds a session where you can do crafts for about 3 hours. So we talk as we knit and bead or other crafts. 

One day I wanted to try a new craft known as punch needle. I got to the library, only to be told by a really nice lady that it wasn't even a PUNCH needle, it was for embroidery. I had a small mental breakdown in the bathroom then came back out and my mom took me home early. 

I had just spent so much money on a kit, and all the tools, and I was pretty upset. The next week, I came back and did a craft I knew pretty well, and my best friend even agreed to hang out with me there. So we where about an hour in, the nice lady hands me a real punch needle and told me she would keep a look out for a bigger one that could use yarn instead of thread. I thanked her and hugged her, and as I sat back down, she kissed me on the head and said, “your a good kid”

That's the thing I like to think of when I'm upset with how my life it turning out. I will never forget that nice lady who will ever have a place in my heart. Oh, and so will Harvey, the other lady's dog.

In the fifth grade, a boy and a girl, Ruby (a tall redneck looking boy with black hair and glasses) and Neon (a short city girl with blonde hair and glasses) respectively, had a band class together. A few months in N gives R her phone number. They text alot, and apparently R's mom had realized something. Driving home from a concert she nudged R saying ""You must be really dim if you dont see it"" ""See what?"" ""That the girl likes you!"" ""She does not, we're just friends!"" ""Well i saw how she looked at you, and i know more about girls than you so."" Over the next few weeks R started realizing that his mom was right. He also realized he liked N too. He built up courage to talk to her about it, and asked her (over text, he wasnt THAT brave) ""Hey I was wondering, if you were dating anyone?"" ""No. Why are you asking?"" Well I was wanting to ask you If."" ""If what?"" ""If you would like to go somewhere as like a date?"" ""Yeah that sounds like fun!"" He was surprised and bewildered. He couldn't believe it. She had actually said yes! He was ecstatic, they stayed up until three in the morning figuring out the details, and decided to go see Jurassic World in theaters. When her parents dropped them off they had an hour before the movie so they walked around the mall. N bought them both mood necklaces with their first initial on them. R wore that necklace for years. But they then went and watched the movie, and afterwards N's parents pulled up with matching Jurassic World posters. They continued to go on dates almost every week (getting weird looks from alot of people as he looked years older than her) until 8th grade. He had to switch schools because of a high school prep program. After the program they both went to the same highschool, they were in the same percussion ensemble, same math, and same science. But everything was different. He was friends with the hood kids who smoked pot, drank, and partied. She was friends with the preps who never did anything wrong. He had low grades and she was in the honour roll. She lived in a nice house with a loving family on the good end of town, and he lived in a crappy house with a family who hated each other, on the end of town where people got shot every day. He drank himself under the table and she did her homework. They argued all the time, never went out on dates, and rarely saw each other. Then one day she had enough. She told me that she felt as if we werent even friends anymore. She said she couldnt take it. She told him they should split up. He was devastated. He never cried, but that night he cried in his mothers arms. Bawling like a baby, the whole time he told himself ""its my fault"" ""real men dont cry, so stop"" ""i drove her away"" ""i hurt her"" and so many other things. Months later he tried to date again, and dated three girls before he decided he couldnt. Ruby couldn't understand what was wrong. He didnt love any of those girls, and he couldn't figure out why. He started drinking again, and ended up texting Neon. ""Hey. Im sorry for everything i put you through. Im sorry i couldn't be there for you when you needed me. I broke my promise i made all those years ago. Im sorry. And i understand."" She text back telling him ""Its not all your fault. You have a different life. You dont have to apologize."" A few months later Ruby and Neon started talking again. Not as Girlfriend and Boyfriend, but as friends. A few months before Junior year, he invited her to go get coffee. She said she would love to go. When he got to her house they were both shaking, talkative, and really nervous. After they got coffee they walked to the gas station and bought some water and monsters for later. They spent the rest of the day at her house watching TV and talking. That day was today. I still love her, but have no clue if she feels the same. Im sorry for what i put her through, and wish i could have been a better boyfriend, but im hoping to make it up by just being her friend. She will always be the love of my life. But i wont make her love me. I wont do that to her again. Im better, i dont drink anymore. Although she never knew i did. Its something im very ashamed of. I love you K.

So because I don't really live where my family lives, I don't get to see them that often. So today we had a family dinner at one of my aunt and uncles house, which was amazing! Then me, trying to kind of fit in with my family, asked if they could teach me pool, which my uncle said yes. 

During that time a few of my cousin's and uncles came to where the basement was and they watched and tried helping me. Then, one of my uncle's (I'll call him uncle J) was like ""hey, what's that on your legs?"" Then I looked down and I was like, oh crap. So I was wearing shorts, which I don't usually do because I have a BUNCH of scars from stress and all that. I was gonna start to answer my uncle's question, then, my other uncle (lets call him uncle k) was like, ""those are scars!"" Which I was like, now they are going to ask the questions of what happened and bla bla bla... And as I was thinking that, my uncle J was like ""not that, I was asking about the thing behind her leg!"" As I looked back, there was a spider web that my uncle k threw on to me by accident, which I didn't see, in which I was like come on man! And that was that.

I guess it really wasn't a big move, but now that I'm thinking and typing this, I'm really happy that I have this family. They didn't really care about my scars, why they were there, or bothering me about it either! They just, let it be! Which I was SO grateful for and honestly almost cried because of it.

Mandatory warning: I'm newish to Reddit and this is my first post ever to Reddit so conservative criticism is appreciated.

Back story: In the 6th grade I had to move away over thanksgiving break due to financial issues. I had 3 friends but we were thick as thieves so I was going to miss them, but I didn't think most of the school would have noticed that I had moved away.

Any way on the last week had at that middle school everyone in my first period class had signed a giant poster board as a gift also gave me pens for others to sign it as well. 

Over the last week I lugged that thing around and just about everyone I knew at that school sighed that including people and staff I did not know well. It meant so much to know the impact I had on the school.

So ever since when ever a student, teacher, or staff member had to leave in the middle of the school year I would do something similar just to let them know what great person they were.

TDLR I had to move in the middle of the school year and got a giant poster board with signatures and ever since I try to do something similar for students, teachers, or staff members.

191happy,happy,"Ahhhh, ok, I just wanted to share about my basketball coach, who is probably one of the main reasons I'm still here today

To preface this, let me tell you a bit about myself, just to paint this picture a little better. I have gross and fine motor delay (which I'm happy to answer questions about in the comments) and multiple physical issues in my leg muscles, joints, and spine, all of which contribute to making me an incredibly unathletic and uncoordinated person. In other words, *I am not someone who should still be on a basketball team.* So, when I went out for a basketball team the spring before my high school year, I was trying to be realistic. I knew I would be cut in the Fall, but I wanted to enjoy what time I had left with my favorite sport. However, my coach had other ideas.  


She would show up early to help me work on my shooting form and stay late to make sure I understood a play, even if that meant having me follow behind her in the middle of a drill so I could see how I should be moving (something that's really helpful for me because I have issues understanding how to move myself). However, even with all that extra work, I was still the last person off the bench. When the time came for my post-season meeting, my coach cried when she told me I was going to be cut, and I've never heard someone say ""Yes!"" faster than she did after I asked if I could manage the team.  


I've been managing for her for a few years now, and not a day has passed by where she has not told me that she appreciates me. She celebrates my achievements, encourages me through my hardest times, and never fails to have my back. Even though I'm just a manager, she will do anything to make me feel as if I were just as much a part of the team as one of the players, including having me letter as a Varsity athlete (despite my zero minutes of playing time).

I was of course excited about it. The concert was 18:00, so we got to see other concerts that were earlier. 

I was in front of the stage at the sound test. I began to get nervous. There were just a few people there, which meant that there weren't many other people to look at other than me. Nothing much happened until the concert was about to start. 

I was still standing at the front when the concert started. I had already hyped myself up a bunch. Then Girl in Red came out on the stage. I got so excited and happy that I wanted to sit down and cry my heart out. I had to squeeze my thumb until it turned red. I cried a bit, but I managed to hold most of it in.

A few years ago an account on Instagram followed me, this person posted quotes which were sad, deep etc... I didn't think anything of it and moved on, followed them back to be nice. 
I didn't really see their posts anymore as my page grew and I began following new bands, new meme pages and my new friends. 
For some reason, one of their posts popped up in my feed at the beginning of 2019. I checked out their profile, noticed some pictures of arms with cuts and scars on them. I decided to dm them. Felt stupid for not speaking to them when they followed me, but anyway, spoke to them, told them that I'm there if they wanted to talk and that I'm always willing to help. They told me to speak to them on their main account. So I followed and here's the turning point I guess, it was a girl, probably one year older than me, she seemed so happy in her posts. Then I realized, we will never know what others go through (most of the time). This realization hit me pretty hard because I'm apathetic and careless most of the time... This girl seemed to be okay, so happy, full of life, but her second account said otherwise. I learned that she had a boyfriend, tons of friends, she seemed to be perfectly fine.

 I volunteer at a food bank that has a big event once a month called distribution week. It's where people who qualify can get the food they need for the month. And on occasion we have a small box of random candy we find that we give to kids with parents permission of course. I was at the first table in line explaining to people how stuff worked and sending them down the line. It was about halfway through the day when a large family of 2 mouthers and 6 kids came through. The adults didn't know to much English as they had just come to the usa and weren't doing well in the December wether as they all were in big coats.

 I asked both mom's if the pack of knee highs would want so sweets and they said yes. So I spent some time holding the box out making sure they all got one before I put it back behind me. When they were done I put it away but a little girl in the cart didn't appear to want anything and was looking at her mom something saying ""kneepop"". I didn't understand what that meant so looked to see if she wanted something on the table and I saw she was pointing at the knitted hats on my table and thought she wanted one. I spent some time helping the family pick one out for each kid. Even getting a really cute sparkling purple one for the cart girl that kinda matched her mother's head wrap (sorry I didn't know the name for it ). 

All warm and ready I sent them down the line except the little girl kept looking at her mom saying "" kneepop kneepop kneepop"". I didn't think much of it cuz I was used to cranky kids in the line. I thought it was over till her mom came back up the line 15 minutes later the little girl next to her and pointing at me saying ""kneepop kneepop"". (This is what our conversation went like)

Sg: * shakes head no* kneepop

I had a CW who had special needs. Our grocery store regularly employed people with special needs. She also suffered from seizures. We were both baggers/cart gatherers, and I was also the utility clerk (janitor).

One day we were sent out to get carts. This wasn't uncommon, and I had gone to a cart corral to gather a bunch together to start the process. I looked down the strip and found a bunch of people gathered around and a car partially pulled out from its space. I went down to find out what was going on. CW was on the ground, C1 had her head in her hands.

Me: Did she have a seizure?

C1: Yes, I called 911.

C2: I  looked on her emergency alert  bracelet (bracelet some people wear that tells what their health condition are, what medicines they're allergic to, emergency contact numbers) and called her mother.

Me: Did you call the store?

C1: No.

I took out my phone and called the store. Me: CW has had a seizure in the parking lot.

PM: What?!

Me: CW has had a seizure in the parking lot. We've called 911 and her Mother. Letting you know.

PM: Okay.

A few minutes later the Pharmacist came out to check up on CW. An ambulance showed up not much later, and CW went to the hospital. Turns out, PM had panicked when I told him about what happened. Fortunately, another Manager was there and knew what to do and contacted the Pharmacist to let her know she was needed in the parking lot.

These customers were great! I'm amazed every time I think about it because they all stopped what they were doing (there were about 20 people gathered around) to help and make sure no one accidentally ran over her!

Backstory:

So when I was around 5 or 6, I went to a summer camp and I had a crush on this girl. young children love.

Story:

One day, I went to summer camp, and it was the last day of it, so I knew I had little time to confess, so at the end of the day, I told her: (exact words, I was mainly filled in from my mom and she had good memory)

Me: C, I love you, will you be my love?

P: Aww (about 10-15 people, including mine and C's mom)

C: No, sorry.

Me: C you broke my heart.

Hotel: oof. Trivago.

Me: *walks away starting to cry*

So later, my mom took me to some place that rhymes with dac monalds, which was my favorite place to eat.at the time, and I get my usual, a cheeseburger without anything else, Don't judge me, I was young. So we sit down and start eating, and this is the conversation me and m have.

M: hey baby, you sad?

Me: yeah

M: well look over there *points to a table*

And who else would it be other than C. I instantly look away and at my burger, than C walks up to me and m and says this to me.

C: hey, sorry about earlier, I was just wondering if you would like to come sit with us?

Me: *hesitant* sure.

So yeah, I went over and sat with them and for the rest of the day after that, playing with friends after getting home, was really great.

229happy,happy,"I worked as a waitress for 8 years, but moved on after I decided  to go back to college a few years ago. I had a family that used to come in pretty regularly. It was a mom, dad, and two boys, one was about 5 or 6 and the other was around 7 or 8. The parents were lovely people. Very sweet, very polite, and just extremely pleasant to be around. The kids were just solid gold. They had the best manners I've ever seen any kids have, and they were just wonderful. 

It was pretty obvious that the boys were adopted because both parents were white, light haired and blue eyed, but both of the boys were black. They seemed like a genuinely happy family.

I had waited on this family several times and got to know them a little bit. One evening they came in and had their meals, then ordered dessert. It was out of the ordinary because in all of the times I've waited on them they had never gotten dessert. But I don't think much of it and go and fix their desserts and bring them out. As I'm serving them the younger boy says to me:

""We're having dessert because we're celebrating!""

Me: ""That's cool. What are you celebrating?""

The older boy says: ""It's our anniversary. It's been one year since we became a family!""

Both of the boys just looked so happy and sweet, and the parents looked so proud. They were all smiles and it was beautiful. 

Me: ""That's so awesome! Congratulations!""

I used to work as a cashier at Knotts Berry Farm in a small souvenir shop that sold jungle related memorabilia. One day, I had just come in to relieve my co-worker's shift. She was leaving with her till in hand and I was carrying a new cash till over to insert into the register. I noticed there was an elementary school group of students browsing around while their teacher kind of hovered around nearby. I was always nervous with large crowds like this, because it's really easy for people to steal while using their friends as a shield to hide their activities. I wasn't about to drop my guard just because their teacher was there. I guess I was paying too much attention to the kids and not enough to where I was going because I suddenly tripped and dropped my till, causing tons of loose change to fly everywhere. I internally cringed as this was the perfect opportunity for some entitled brats to scoop up what they could and run off with it. Surprise, surprise, as soon as the cash started rolling LG dived down to collect as many as she could.

**Me** (trying not to panic): Sweety, that's not-

I was about to say ""That's not yours"" but before I could finish the sentence, LG had dumped what was in her hand into my till and ran off to collect more coins. I was dumbfounded and sat there watching her for a disbelieving minute, before I started gathering up the ones nearby as well. The rest of her class either just stared at us or ignored us, but nobody else moved to help. Once I was fairly certain I'd gotten it all back, I thanked LG and she just smiled and went back to browsing with her class.

I was so touched by her selfless gesture that I wanted to do something for her in return. After setting up my till, I waited until her browsing brought her close to my register again, then gestured for her to come closer.

**Me**: Hey, thanks again for helping me. That was really nice of you.

**LG**: (smiling shyly) It's okay.

She was about to walk away again when I called her back.

**Me**: Hey! If you could have any toy in the store, which one do you like best?

**LG**: (looking confused) A toy?

**Me**: Yeah.

She looked around for a minute, considering. I then remembered there was an $80 giant giraffe plushy against the wall and briefly regretted my choice of the word 'any'. Luckily, her gaze finally came to rest on something much cheaper. She pointed to a stuffed black and white tiger toy, worth around $15 or so.

**LG**: That one.

**Me**: The tiger? You're sure?

**LG**: Yeah, it's cute.

**Me**: (smiling grandly) Bring it here, please.

She complied and handed it to me. At this point, some of her classmates and teacher had noticed our conversation and were watching with interest.

**T**: What's going on?

**Me**: (Ringing up the tiger and charging it to my debit card) This is a thank-you gift to your student for being such a nice person and being the only one who helped me when my coins fell earlier.

I handed the tiger to LG, who looked surprised, but then smiled happily.

**LG**: I can keep this?

**Me**: Of course! It's your thank-you gift.

**T**: Are you sure?

**Me**: Absolutely. She deserves it.

I could hear the other students who were watching begin to mutter among themselves, probably bummed that they'd missed out on their chance to get free stuff. The teacher thanked me a few times and then they left. On their way out, I could hear the students who hadn't seen what had happened, ask LG about the tiger and her replying excitedly that she'd gotten it for free for helping the lady pick up her coins.

It was in very early January, my friend and I were attending our town's anime convention for the second day in a row. The first day was a blast as I got to meet some wonderful people, see some great shows and win my first smash ultimate tournament match (I lost the tournament but that's not the point).

However, the second day was were things came in. I was standing in line to meet the voice of Tomura Shigaraki (My Hero Academia), Eric Vale.

CD complimented me on my cosplay and we nerded out over anime, Nintendo and all sorts of stuff. The line finally ends and it's my turn to get an autograph. The way it works there is you hold onto a ticket passed out to you and then hand it over. There's a variety of free stuff the person can sign or bigger and more cool posters for money. 

There was only one problem

The person collecting the tickets said there they weren't giving out free stuff and you had to either bring your own item or purchase something. My heart literally sank when I heard this. A few seconds in and CD steps in and says he'll pay for a poster for me. I was shocked completely. This random person I knew for the duration of the line was willing to spend money on a poster for me. We picked out a poster which ended up being around 35 dollars and I eventually got to meet Vale and have a small conversation with him. I later saw the guy on my way to the exit and I thanked him so much. While it's small I'm glad that I was able to meet him.

237happy,happy,"I don't know if this story is wholesome enough for this subreddit, but I still want to share it. This story happened several years ago, when I was in high school. I went to one of those high schools that offer a french immersion program for english teens who wanted to keep practicing the french skills they learned in elementary school (it's a requirement in my country). Since it was in a primarily english city, there weren't that many high school teachers who could teach in french, so most of them taught multiple subjects. Because of that, students in the french immersion program always have the same teachers for their french classes for their entire 4 years of high school. 

In my high school, we had these two really great teachers. Lets call them Mrs. B and Mrs. H for short. Everyone in my class loved them. Even though they were teaching multiple subjects to us, it was obvious that they were passionate about teaching and the subjects they were teaching. They would both talk at length about it and actively get the class involved with activities, even saying their own opinions and comments about the subject being taught. Most of the time it was funny sarcastic comments about a stupid decision a book character made, or about how the Bible is organized. They would also poke fun at themselves and their students in harmless ways. Not only that, but they also genuinely cared about their students and do whatever they can to help them, like allowing a clearly distressed student to skip class so that she can go speak to a school councillor, or giving bottles of medicated shampoo to a student with lice who couldn't afford those pricey shampoos. Their classes were always a blast of laughter and smiles, and everyone loved them.

At the end of our last year in high school, my class wanted to thank Mrs.B and Mrs.H for being such amazing teachers, and for sticking through our teen shenanigans  for the past 4 years. We all knew that it's not easy to teach a bunch of rowdy, inexperienced teens, let alone the same groups of rowdy teens every year. Simply giving a thank you card wasn't good enough to express our gratitude towards them. So, we pooled our money together and bought each of them a big bouquet of roses. One rose from every student, which means they each got a bouquet of 20+ roses. And we wanted to give them with a big surprise. 

Our classes with Mrs.B and Mrs.H were our two last classes of the day, right after our lunch break, with Mrs.B being first, followed by our joint class with Mrs.H. On our last day of school, during our lunch break, we snuk into the classroom and started decorating it, writing a big and colourful ""Thank You"" on the white board. Then, we stood at the front of the class, turned off the lights, and waited for Mrs.B to arrive at the start of the class. She eventually does arrive, and got a little suspicious that the lights were off when there should've been a class full of students. She turns it on, and we yell ""Surprise!"" She jumped a little, and looked a little confused. Then, it registered in her head what was going on, and smiled from ear to ear. During our 4 years with her, we never saw her with such a big smile. The rest of that class was spent taking pictures, and giving Mrs. B the roses and thanking her for all of her hard work. Now it was time for Mrs.H's surprise.

Since Mrs.H's class was a joint class with the grade below us, and they didn't know of our plan, so we couldn't risk doing the ""turn on the light surprise"" for fear that one of the students would turn on the light and spoil the surprise for Mrs.H. So, we hid in the class next door until the class started. The teacher was cool with it, since were won't be staying there for long. Mrs.H entered her classroom and got confused about why only half the class were present, and why its only the graduating half that is missing. She asks Mrs.B, who was quietly working at her desk in the back, and, being the champ that she is, pretended to not know where we were. She also hid her bouquet of roses, too. Mrs.H, still confused, started the lesson. Shortly after, my class walks into the classroom, in line, and we also gave her our roses and said thank you and how much we appreciate her. She was just as happy as Mrs.B, and was almost in tears. She said how much she would miss us after we graduate, and then composed herself to teach this final lesson.

I don't know if Mrs.B and Mrs.H are still teaching at that school or not, or what they did with those roses, but I still remember that day fondly. Great teachers deserve to feel appreciated by their students.",1,2.059562842,-2.261748634,-0.114754098,-2.979508197

I'am 18 now and I found a courage to go there without having emotional breakdown, and when I was passing on my yard a neighbour call to me by name, I used to buy and carry big milk kegs from him when I was 10 and he recognized me after 8 years, and not only him I also ran into my childhood friends with whom I played soccer with, after we talked and went our ways I realized I had tears in my eyes because despite me leaving this place for 8 years everyone remembered me and I remembered them.

My school does this big field trip for the music programs at a big amusement park in a nearby state (I live in the US) 
So I go with a group of friends and it's almost the end of the trip. I'm going to get some dinner as it really late. The trip has a rule where no student can go off by themselves. 
I'm standing in line with a friend and we're chatting I'm counting my money when I stop talking.
Friend: Um Sakura? (not my real name) are you ok?
I miscounted my money I was a dollar off on getting actual food. There were two options I chose the more expensive one (I think it was 6 dollars?) As it had fries and mini corn dogs. I could only afford the fries. I almost start crying because I mainly ate junk food all day, and I was really hungry.
Friend: I can go get my dad and he can give you a dollar (her dad was a chaperone)
Me: no remember I can't be by myself (the chaperones and teachers were really strict about that I don't remember the punishment though)
I'm panicking as I'm getting closer to the front and my friend doesn't have any extra cash. 
Me: well I'll just have to get the fries.....
Nice Lady, who was behind us: Excuse me? Did you say you needed a dollar?
Me: yeah I miscounted my money I don't have enough to get something more filling than the cheapest option
And God smiled down at me that day as the lady gives me a dollar.
I remember thanking her at least 6 times and she just smiled and said it was ok. I got my food and thanked the lady again, then I and my friend left with my faith in humanity was restored.

So Nice Lady that helped out that kid a year ago at an amusement park? If you're somehow reading this Thank you so much and I still remember you.",1,13.66081871,-0.263157895,0.105263158,0.105263158

265happy,happy,"I work at a fairly known pop culture and music store. We're known for the more controversial things in our store. This was around Christmas, I think 4 days after. I was working front of store. Just greeting customers and cleaning up around the front. Explaining deals and refolding shirts.

In comes this adorable little boy along with his father. His father is holding him as he looks around the bright colors in the store. I greet them and the boy shies away from me, leaning into his fathers neck. I help the father find a band shirt and his son a plushie from either Cuphead or Bendy (I don't remember which). I direct them to the line to check out and head back to the front of the store. As I'm working I see them start to walk out of the store, the son hugging his plushie and the dad smiling with him.

So we are planning to head to the amusement park and was told not to eat to much as we would be getting dizzy from rides. I had eaten to much and went on some rides. I was ok. At the end of the night I feel like shit and am gonna throw up. I go on one last ride. I puke on myself and tremble getting off the ride. I was laid down on a nearby bench, my shorts being thrown in the trash. I am now sick, and in my underwear. A, right then and there takes off his shorts and gives them to my aunt to give to me. My aunt hands me A's shorts and I put them on. I stand up with the help of my older brother and hug him crying. We walk out of the park.A in boxers, me  in slight oversized basketball shorts. I'm sobbing tears of joy knowing what he would do for his little cousin. He is just the best. We laugh about it now anytime I head to their house in NY or NJ.

While standing in line at the local Walmart, waiting to pay for my stuff. 

There was a woman, about mid 30's, standing in line, in front of me. She had her daughter with her. The little girl looked to be about 5 or 6. 

Anyway, I was standing in line about ten minutes, when another woman, also in her mid 30's, and her daughter walked in line behind me. The only difference was, this girl looked to be about 9 or 10. She was carrying a little Elmo purse

I heard the first little girl say, “Mommy, can I have a purse like that?”, pointing at the Elmo purse. Sadness grow on her mother's face as she said to her, “I'm sorry, honey, Mommy doesn't have the money for things like that since Daddy died.”

The little girl just hung her head. 

My heart sank. 

Just then, the little girl standing behind me, with the Elmo purse says, “Excuse me.”, and walks past me and up to the other little girl. Apparently, she too, heard what was said. 

Anyway, she walked up to the little girl and said, “My Daddy bought this for me, before the Army sent him overseas and he died too. He taught me to share, I want you to have it”, and handed her the little Elmo purse.

She then turned around, said, “Excuse me.” again and walk back to her mother, who hugged her and said, “That was nice thing to to do.”  The little girl just smiled at her. 

The first little girl says, “Mommy look!!” With a big smile on her face. 
Her mother says, “Very nice, what do you say?” The little girl turns around and says, “Thank you.” Her mother lifted her head, and mouthed the words, “Thank you” to the second little girl. 

I almost started crying right there in line. 

The first mother and daughter paid for their stuff and left. I paid for my stuff and left as well. 

I sat in my car for about a half hour, just thinking about what I just witnessed. Just when I think humanity is at its lowest. It takes one little girl, with a little Elmo purse, to prove me wrong. 

Good job, little girl, good job!!!

273happy,happy,"So I don't really know if this storie really fits here, but I think it's really cute so please give it a read and judge for yourself.

So I worked a caretaker in a summer camp during my summer break. It's for children from ages 6 up to 10. 
The little girl in question was one of the younger ones, probably around 7 or 8.
 I watched over some children while they were painting and was talking to them, when a girl asked my how much I weigh. Children are more open to ask such questions, than adults are so I did not mind. 
,,65kg."" I said. 
The girl who asked said ,,I was at the doctor's yesterday and he said I weigh 23kg.""
 A boy said ,, Mommy said I weigh 31kg."" 
A girl who'd listening to that looked really concerned. I asked her if she was ok and she said quietly ,,I weigh so much more than everyone else.""  
I tried to tell her that it didn't matter and she was still was a pretty girl and as long as she was healthy ect.... She was indeed a little chubby so I thought she weight maybe 10 kg more and was upset about that but I asked her just to be sure.
 ,, I got on the scale last evening and it said 400kg''. She didn't belive me when I said that must have overlooked a point on the scale, so I told her to go on the scale after school and really look for a point between the numbers, because that means she only weighs as much the numbers before the point (I didn't want to confuse her with decimal numbers). 
The next day she came up to me and said she found the point on the scale and that she only weights 40kg with a smile on her face.
