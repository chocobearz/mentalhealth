1,sad,"to be honest i dont know what to do. My family is truly breaking me and this point.

my parents like to remind me that im the smart one. ill pay for their care when they are older so i have to get a good job but anytime i bring up something im always shot down. i dont understand or im giving them attitude. 

my little sister has stolen over �200 off me over the past 5 months and anytime i bring it up. all i get is well you shouldnt have left it around. my little sister hasnt done any school work for the past month over quarantine and they expected me to tutor her while im in sixth form studing history law and business. when i said im busy they said too bad and you have to do it and when i told them she wouldnt listen to me they said they would take her phone. my mum says my dad will take it my dad doesnt as he said its her problem if she doesnt want to do her work. this is one situation of so many. 

all my family tells my parents that she is spoiled but they say she'll grow out of it. 

my big sister is a narcissist anytime something goes wrong she throws a temper tantrum. shes 24 with a kidand they try and fix what inconvenienced her. An example of this is that my parents already paid of her debt of over �2000 less then 8 months ago and now shes in bad debt again. 

my only escape from this family has been my nan and she just diagnosed with parkinsons. i honestly dont know what to do anymore i know that they're so toxic but their still my family amd as much as they have pit me through i do love all of them so much. Though i dont think i can survive here much longer cause i generally cant remember the last time i was happy and honestly i catch myself wanting to end it all too many time to count.",-2
2,sad,"The title says it all. My husband died 3 years ago, and it�s been hard. I lost so many friends from the initial shock of losing him, than slowly lost the rest. I have no friends now. Like really, none. My best friend turned her back on me from the constant internal battle I�ve been dealing with. My family is not a good place to go for any emotional support. I met one of the most wonderful men. I�m so damaged that I have slowly and effectively pushed him away. It�s like I don�t even want to be happy. But, I do. I want to feel heard and that someone actually cares about me. I�ve tried a couple therapists, but it was so uncomfortable at the time. And not on the telling my deepest darkest struggles, but in the sense that I feel judged and not accepted as I am. And Everything feels so chaotic. I have some physical health issues that are weighing heavy on me right now and just nowhere to turn to. I have a big birthday coming up and no one to spend it with. Everyone looks at me as a strong woman, so I don�t need anyone? I�m so tired. I just want to give up. Thank you for letting me vent.",-1
3,sad,i woke up this morning to a notification that naya rivera had gone missing. ive been freaking out ever since. i am so impacted by celebrity disappearances and deaths. i spent a month literally unable to think of Kobe Bryant without bursting into tears. i spend hours thinking about mac miller after he died bc he seemed like he really wanted to live. and so on and so on. i am really really not doing well with this.,-1

I�ve been depressed since I was 13, I�m 23 now. I�m bipolar with ptsd, I�m medicated, I�m going to therapy- I�m doing everything I�m supposed to to try and get better. I�m still sad and angrier than ever. Is this it? Is this what my life is going to be like forever? I�m so tired",-2
5,sad,"Is this even the right sub? 

I'm angry. All the time. Its my first reaction, especially recently. I'm not even sure why my husband puts up with it. I can only say that I'm sorry so many times before it loses it meaning... I am sorry, it's not supposed to be directed at him. But that what ends up happening. 

I figured it was time to start looking into therapy or something..",-1
6,sad,"Sometimes, I'll loose the ability to move a part of my body, it doesn't last for a long time maybe like fifteen minutes at most. It's a bizarre feeling cause I don't feel like my muscles won't work it feels like its just off I can't effect the muscles. It's really bizarre sense I feel like I can but just won't but like I really want to, I never had this happen without knowing what catatonia is, so it feels like I'm just doing it like a placebo, but I can not not do it. Like if feels like I'm willingly doing it but not able to do it. How do I fix this",0
7,sad,"For about a year now my emotions have been repressed and I just want to feel them again. It's like every day I'm living in a sort of ""neutral"" mood where I'm not happy or sad, I feel like a hint of sadness but it's so minimal it's barely noticeable. I've only ever felt happy twice this year and I just want to feel happy again, I want to feel passion and motivation again cause not even I know when the last time I experienced it was. Is there anyway to deal with these repressed emotions without going to a therapist (they are all still closed by me :()",-1
9,sad,"Has a Christian I know I am supposed to love thy neighbor. I gotta tell you this world is evil. People are Godless. It is written the end will be as Sodom and Gomorrah. Well we've surpassed that mark. 
I pray to die and leave this place but each day I awake to find nothing different. There appears to be no escape from human stupidity and ignorance. I don't like you, I don't trust you, I don't want to be around you.
If I could've gotten the monies on my GoFundMe campaign I'd left for an isolated island or country.",-3
10,sad,"I guess this is mostly a rant, but I�ve been feeling so alone in my own head that I could really use some support. This is the first time I�ve ever opened up about any of this stuff. Here goes: When I was 5, I was diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome, ADHD (combined type), OCD, ODD, and manic depression. 
I am now about to turn 30 (female, FYI). These past 5 years I�ve been doing a lot of therapy and research to understand, for the first time In my life, what ADHD actually looks like and how it effects me. I think the more I understand, the angrier I have become about it. I�m not so sure about ODD because I haven�t done any research into it, but I have recently done a lot of research on OCD and it made a lot of things make a lot of sense. At the same time, it�s made me realize what a cluster f*ck I am. Oh and manic depression is now known as bipolar, which I am not (guess it�s hard to tell when you are 5). My psychiatrist has given me new diagnoses of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder (in place of the manic depression/bipolar). Oh and how can I forget my complex PTSD? 
I spend the majority of my mental energy hating myself. No matter what I accomplish, I can never live up to my own expectations. And I�m always so angry that everything has to be twice as hard for me as it is for a neurotypical person. I finally made two friends who also have ADHD and I thought I�m finally not alone anymore, but I quickly realized I am way more f*cked up than they are. Is anyone else suffering from such a stupid amount of disorders? Or am I alone on this one? :/",-2
11,sad,"So at the moment I'm not in the BEST mental state. It's been a whole hell of a lot worst so I know I will get through this. For context I s3lf harmed in the past and I have been clean for months now. But I recently had a dream were I relapsed. And for some reason that's is giving me some urges to start again. So it's just been a bit draining. And my friends are actually making things a bit worst ??

They wanted to meet up today. I was happy bc I miss them and I thought seeing them would get my mind off of things
But I think they are trying to play wing man for my other friend who might like me?

They keep dropping hints that something is going on, questioning my sexuality, and leaving us alone with each other. Along with some other things, that I will not lost bc this rant is already to long

them doing this stuff makes me feel even worst. I get physical nauseous when ever we are alone together because I'm so scared he will tell me he likes me and I'll hurt him. I'm not ready for a relationship and I don't even know if I see him like that. It really sucks bc my friends are just trying to help him so I'm obviously not mad at them, but I just wished they wouldn't.",-1
12,sad,"I am in a long distance relationship with a sleepy gamer and I love her so much and I want to talk to her so much all day but we live 1700 miles away so there is a three hour time difference so we don't get to talk much because she is sleeping so much and gaming a lot and I always ask to call at night and she says maybe and she will see if she can but every night she ends up falling asleep and I end up brushing it off cause I understand she is a gamer and I don't want her to stop that just cause of me but its annoying how I'm always the one that asks to call and when I get really sad that I can't just hug her I tell her and I ask her to call cause her voice always makes me feel better but its still always the same answer and then she games and doesn't respond for about an hour so I'm just left in my sadness not able to talk to her and when I say I'm getting tired cause its 5 in the morning for me and I'm just hopeing that she will call me and then she responds and says ""ugh i feel so bad I'm horrible I just want to make you feel better"" and I want to believe her but why doesn't she make time for me then? Its just so frustrating and I needed to say something to someone or I'm going to explode.",-2
13,sad,"Covid has obviously had a massive negative effect on mental health but as someone who has gotten progressively worse over the past couple months I feel as if I have been huddled with all of the covid related cases when I really don't really think that's the issue

As a 17M going to school covid hasn't really effected much of my life, I don't have any close friends at school. Not one I talk to outside of school and have group of friends I used to see on the weekend but that's it. Whereas now I play games with them for hours a day every day and have lots of fun

16,sad,"You did it again.. you got quiet, you got sad, you left. It was already hard enough being in the presence of someone you can barely compete with to complete your goal.. but then you learn all these new things that absolutely tear what�s left of your heart to pieces and make you think of bad possibilities.. I want to keep trying but this time it�s like everything is telling me to just give up and forget about my ""happily ever after"" and die. I�m just all alone again.. today was supposed to be good.. you were supposed to make progress towards your goal, but now you know you�re just gonna curl up in bed and cry and hurt yourself because you don�t know what else to do and you have no one.

17,sad,"I haven�t been myself these past couple of days. I have wanted to self harm between the moments of pure joy and utter bliss. I have my extreme highs and extreme lows and there�s never any in between.

I�ve been in and out of hospitals for two years. I�ve been on and off disability with various jobs for a combined total of about a year.

As of this moment, my doctor hasn�t responded to my refill request for about 10 days. I�ve been off a cocktail of psychiatric medications for about 10 days. No mood stabilizer to keep me down, no anti-depressant to keep me up, no anti-anxiety med except klonopin suppressing the overwhelming sensation of panic, no anti-psychotic suppressing the voices.

I�m totally and utterly fucked.

Nothing seems to get better.

I�m currently sitting here with a bottle of gabapentin and a bottle of klonopin contemplating my options. I don�t know what to do.",-3
18,sad,"Hi y'all.

So, first time posting in this subreddit and I'm not entirely sure if this is the right place, so feel free to redirect me to a more appropriate place.

Here is the problem: I turned 32 last friday and I usually take this occasion to give myself some time to think about the year gone by, my current feelings on things and evaluate future plans. While talking with my girlfriend about those topics, I noticed her bringing up some events - things that we experienced in our 10 year long relationship - that I had a hard time remembering. It wasn't just blurry, or some details were missing. I simply had no memory of it, neither vivid nor abstract.

By then I realized how often I had the problem of going along stories of my friends, especially those that directly revolve around, or include, me. It seems like everyone around me has some funny, insightfull or just interesting anecdotes to share, but I can't even connect to those memories on a very basic level so I just go along. Apart from some key moments in my life, a lot seems to be fuzzy, or just nonexistent. This doesn't just apply to events that happened way back, but very specific events that happened rather recently, especially with events revolving around my five year old daughter. If it weren't for pictures that I could reference, I'd be completely dumbfolded. The same applies to sports: I've been training and practizing Ninjutsu for 10 years, two times a week and I'm currently undergoing sort of a mentorship program for aspring trainers, but A LOT of the techniques I can do seem to stem from muscle memory alone. I often don't remember learning them and couldn't name them, even though we have a pretty systematic approach due to them being compiled by similarity in - literally - scrolls. No one of my peers seems to have that issue.

It seems this is getting worse, with more recent memories just fading much, much faster. There is no history of mental health issues, dementia or other neurological disorders in my family that I know of. I don't use drugs, don't take any medication and have a rather healthy lifestyle. 
Does anyone know of this or a similar issue? What approach should I take in order to treat, or get treatment, for this? 


I'd be very thankfull for any sort of help!",0
19,sad,I have so much pain in my life one thing could compensate for that but I can't have it. I've never been in a relationship at 19 and it just keeps eating away at me it's only a matter of time before I hurt someone else or myself.,-3
20,sad,My parents dont have compromised/ immune diseases or any major condition that could affect them if they got covid. I'm just trying to find ways to tell myself they will be ok. It's just like anyone else obviously worrying about the people they love. But I just still cant get over it.,-1
21,sad,"Thinking it might help to just try and put my feelings down in writing.

I work with a caseload of clients (members of the public) and have a fairly high level of responsibility over what I'm assisting them with. 

I am currently working from home due to Coronavirus which I'm finding difficult in itself , it's just hard to get on with things and get into a work mindset.

I have had a look at CBT and never really intensely tried it but I do know my problems are probably cognitive distortions. IE , my work audits go well, I was recently given a payrise as I'm no longer a ""trainee"" etc. I honestly suspect my colleagues think I'm competent and hard-working and are happy to help me when I need it.

However , I'm currently sat putting off contacting clients as I always worry about messing up or feel that they will be annoyed at me for whatever reason. Fundamentaly I feel quite nervous dealing with the public and meeting them in appointment / talking on the phone etc. I just wish I could be left alone and not have the personal responsibility! I don't know what causes this nervousness , I feel like I appear weird or that that I talk oddly or something! Maybe I am just lazy and like having nothing to do

I feel like I overthink things and sit for hours worrying about problems before taking action , I ask for a lot of reassurance and feel like I think of almost every ""what if scenario!"". In my 9 months in the job , nothing has wrong yet I should add. Although if anything does come out the blue and need dealing with it always frustratingly , one of the things I HADN'T worried about.

I feel that although I really believe in what I'm doing these issues are affecting my enjoyment of the job and I always feel tense and have butterflies In my stomach throughout the work week. If for example , a receptionist calls to put a client through to me I feel mild fear. I honestly don't know what I'm worried is going to happen. I worry that I've messed up something for the client or they're calling to complain or whatever.

Does anyone have any thoughts as to how I can help myself ? I do not have crippling anxiety by any means. I function well. I just want to feel confident and to stop overthinking every thing.",-2
22,sad,"I just had a mental break down screaming and breaking shit and it�s been like that the past couple weeks or so

I can�t control it and I get angry at the smallest thing
I can�t find a job I have no money and I just am LOSING IT

I can�t seem to catch a break- I can�t fucking do anything I don�t wanna hear � well not with that attitude� believe me, I fucking tried with a better attitude 

I can�t control my anger and I think I�m slipping back into who I was a while back. 

I can�t control my anger and it�s debilitating. I haven�t been the same since I got out of an abusive relationship a while back and it�s been like this until it died down a bit. Tho I was still angry it�s become way worse now and idk what to do

The last few months have been such an absolute shitshow and I can't deal with it anymore my mental health has taken a massive hit to the point where I started self harming again, I just hate every part of myself and I've given up on everything.

24,sad,"Hey all, 
With COVID here I'm with my wife a lot and we have been fighting more, it's been several times now and I am realizing I'm really reactive and defensive.

I have a lot of abuse under my belt from my father and the only way I ever was able to maintain my sense of power and self was to doggedly argue and fight him. I was constantly berated, told I would be nothing, physically abused and molested. When I come under fire or perceive a threat to my esteem I react poorly. I have been better in the past but I think I'm not on top of my mental game lately.

I've been able to work through a lot of this but I feel now that I engage my wife when we argue or when I perceive her as being unfair to me like a freaking bear trap.

It doesn't even have to be something that matters, twice I have perceived her as having bad intentions or being unfair to me in the last week and instigated a fight with her.

Literally today I started a fight about her asking me to take a Zoom call on headphones, I decided she was being inconsiderate to ask me to do that because she takes her calls in central space and off of headphones (I'm usually asleep I work nights).

I feel like I can't even control it. I go full right brain.


How do you pump the brakes and be less reactive.",-2
25,sad,"Hello all,
Lately I've been dealing with very bad anxiety. Like I can't function, overwhelming, all consuming anxiety. I've never had anxiety this badly until the past year. Sometimes I understand the root of it, other times I don't. 
I have no copping mechanisms for my anxiety. Except biting my nails, but it doesn't really help. 
What I would like help with especially is dealing with anxiety when it's time to sleep. Take tonight as an example. I'm beyond exhausted. I have a very long day of work ahead of me, and I can't imagine sleeping. 
My anxiety is keeping me awake. I feel like there is a weight on my chest, my body is shaking a bit, and my mind is on high alert. Unfortunately I am too exhausted to do anything productive, while I'm on high alert, my brain is to groggy to do anything. All I can seem to do is sit in bed and write this post. 
Does anyone have any ideas to help me overcome my anxiety enough to sleep? I work the next 7 days in a row and can't afford to waste sleep like this. All advise, thoughts, or consideration is welcome. Please help.",-2
26,sad,"this may not be the correct place for this but i just don�t really know where to go. i don�t even know where to begin with what�s wrong with me. i (18f) have been struggling with my mental health for about 6 or 7 yrs but these past 4 yrs have been the worst i�ve ever been. in my freshman year i was starting to hate school, having huge meltdowns in the car and i missed a lot of school. it was so difficult just to go and i don�t know why i fought it so much. in my junior i started getting extremely forgetful. it was bad then, but now, someone could tell me to do something and i will forget 10 seconds after they tell me or my brain just won�t process it the first time. i�m worried about this because i�m started to forget a lot of my childhood and other people are starting to notice that i�m very forgetful. with that, over the past 4 yrs i�ve become a very angry person and i�ll have literal tantrums if i get mad enough. i�ll scream until my throats sore, i�ll throw stuff, i�ll stomp my feet and punch the walls, like a child. not only that but i�ve realized and personally feel that i�m quite behind a lot of people my age maturity wise and i can�t do a lot on my own. i feel stupid and it�s heavily affecting me because i�m watching everyone move on, pass all their tests, be smarter than me, get into college etc. i only got a 1000 on the SAT and couldn�t retake it because of covid-19. because of all of this i did my own research and some signs are pointing me to adult adhd. this would make sense to me because my entire life i�ve been a disorganized, distracted, fidgety person. i�ve also been told many times in my life that i�ll never been able to take care of myself because of it, and i know that�s not true but i sometimes don�t want to have be alone and do everything by myself. all of that including my recent spike in impulsivity (driving out of
state w/o telling anyone, keying my own car), and the fact that the only reason i�m not doing drugs is because i can�t afford it, i just think it�s time for me to get some help. with that being said, i�ve very afraid to tell my grandparents that i need and want help. i know they would be supportive and understanding but i just can�t bring myself to say anything. i know this was long winded but moral of the story, i�m looking for some advice, i can�t remember anything and i�m worried for myself. if you�ve read this far, thank you :)",-2
27,sad,"Ive been struggling with anxiety and self harm but now it seems like I'm dependant on my imagination to make me happy. It goes like this I spend days ignoring my responsibilities and spending hours indulging in my imagination . But once reality hits I breakdown. Yesterday it was about my weight I made myself throw up and I starved Myself. then I made up and read stories for hours I didn't sleep for 24hr feeling euphoric then reality hit again and I had a mental breakdown. Two days ago I hated myself and this world so much I began cutting again. When I did cut I hated myself even more for not making it one month without cutting. I honestly feel alone and hopeless. I can't talk to my friends and family without my inner thoughts taking over and calling me a narcissist. I can never seem to get things right and have dealt with bullies who make my low self-esteem even worse. 

I'm not sure what any of this is anymore.

28,sad,"Im a 17 year old girl. I hate my body. I can�t stop comparing myself to girls. Sometimes I�ll feel great about my body if I�m wearing something nice then I�ll go out, see others and immediately feel like trash again. 

I have a boyfriend too and I never feel good enough for him. He tells me I�m beautiful sometimes and I know he loves my body but I can�t love my body. I feel like every single girl is better than me and he deserves the pretty girls with nice bodies. It�s not even just my body I feel like my personality is dry and boring. I feel stupid and not good enough for anyone. 

My body is disgusting, my face is disgusting and I just want to be beautiful. I want to be good enough and I want to have a nice body and a nice face. 

Im just obsessed with looking at other girls or women in movies or video games and it sounds stupid but it really does set off my insecurity all over again. I could be doing fine and then I�ll see or hear one little thing and then boom I find myself crying over my body again.

I want to be and feel attractive. Maybe I am. But I can�t see it in myself. How can I better myself? How can I start loving myself? Sorry if any of this sounded weird I�m just sick of being like this.",-2
29,sad,"I just had a sudden crying session an hour ago and I couldn't stop crying until just now. My grandma just passed away last week and as I was scrolling through my Facebook profile earlier, I saw a picture of her smiling so happily and that was when it started. I just couldn't stop crying and as I continued scrolling I saw pictures of my dog which also has passed away when I was younger and all the memories just came rushing back like no one's business. I also thought about my granduncle and my great grandfather. My granduncle had also passed away recently this year all of a sudden while my great grandfather had passed quite a number of years ago. Point is I just remembered all the memories I've had with all of them and I just really want to relive them all over again. I suddenly found it so scary how time waits for no one and everyone would be gone one day and there's no way of reliving the moments from the past.

30,sad,"I�m not thinking about killing myself because I would never do that to my family, but I don�t have the will to live like I used to.

Now none of that even sparks any feeling in me anymore. I used to be so motivated in school to get good grades and keep my GPA up. I used to want to go to medical school, but I don�t know what I want anymore. When I think about my future, now I see nothing. All the thought of my future does now is bring me anxiety.

31,sad,"Hi, this is my first post here, and I'm pretty sure it's a long one. 

I'm 23 years old, I only have an older brother, who is a NEET, so all the respobilities is all on me. I'm the only one who is working, my dad is with another family. He sometimes visits us. My mom is living with my Grandmother and my Uncle. So basically, me and my brother are the only ones here in the house (w/c we only rent)

Here in our house, we have a barber shop and a small store. But ever since the pandemic, it got tough. Not a lot of customers coming to our shop/store. I always think how to pay the bills (rent, water, electricity, internet). Please keep in mind that my salary from working in a company is completely inadequate for the rent alone. 

I always lock myself in my own room, since I don't want to interact with my brother, since he's the type of guy who brags all the time without having any achievements (e.g. studied until high school only, no work, etc.)

I work as an assistant in a financing corporation. I always do my best effort in interacting with clients, with coworkers. However, I always get scolded from other groups, telling me that I'm not doing my job right. There was one time that I literally cried for an hour in the restroom cubicle, because one of my coworker says that I always make the same mistakes. She always scolds me, only noticing the mistakes I made. She never notices the good things I did. 

In work, I never got the chance to know if I did a job well done, I always hear from my work that I always make mistakes. 

This week, I didn't get to report to my work. I have this feeling that I don't want to work, because I will interact with some coworkers, only getting bad vibes from them. At the same time, feeling sad because I can't get to help my other coworkers, making them to work double as to cover my absence. 

It also came to me if I should look for a new job, because the work I have now is pretty much not doing the best for me, especially my self esteem. Also, thinking if I quit, how can I pay the bills here in our house. I did thought of what if, I try to end my life. Thinking of it, I also think of the people who will be left, so it stops me from commiting it. 

Being alone here in my room makes me think a lot of things, I also cried while typing this post. Not sure if I need help, or am I just thinking things. 

I actually asked my friend if he thinks I have a mental illness or not, he told me that I'm just overthinking it and cheers me up that I can overcome this.

32,sad,"Hello there, i guess i'm just here because i just need to vent here but also want to know if anybody has any suggestions on how to cope with things or how they cope with similar things in a healthy way.

Anywho, lately i've been having a sense of dread like something or someone is out to get me and that something is going to happen soon. I feel like its a person or entity, not much of an event like a natural disaster although that is always a concern. I suppose the big reason why i'm writing this is because I felt ill suddenly one night; dizziness and difficulty balancing, nausea, difficulty concentrating, fatigue, that sort of thing. I looked into my water cup to find it a milky white and this send me swiftly moving to the kitchen sink to rinse it out. I noticed a white residue in the bottom, one that I swiftly washed away. Ever since then I've been afraid that what i'm consuming is somehow contaminated, mostly water I drink. Today was especially hard because even though it didn't look any different I felt like my water was somehow wrong and not the same. I couldn't pinpoint what I derived this from but I felt it in my core like it was a survival instinct. I felt like I couldn't tell my parents, however and I didn't know why but, yet again, I just felt it intensely in my being. I haven't drank water all day and i'm now afraid to take my medication in fear that it is also contaminated with something. All I can think of in my head is a white mucus or film and pale white hands brushing against me, whispering to me in languages unknown to any mortal being but in a way that I know i understand deep down somewhere. I don't know, i'm just confused right now. Physically I feel fine but mentally I feel like i'm being watched and assessed and that if i fall asleep I won't wake up. I feel like I can't tell if noises are laughter or crying and it scares the heck out of me and I want to understand whatever is there reaching for me with its dozens of clammy hands and mouths. I don't know, I just need to get this out there. I have a past with psychotic symptoms and anxiety and depression and such things have lead me to the hospital twice and I don't want to go back because i just can't relive things i've seen and heard there without having another dance with trauma.

33,sad,"Every time I start dating someone and I become emotionally invested and attached, I get very anxious and panic. Thoughts of infidelity and not being good enough flood my mind. If he�s taking a while to respond to me, I�ll panic and think he�s talking to some other girl or he doesn�t want to talk to me. In the beginning it�s usually manageable and I can talk it out with my partner but it gets worse and worse as time moves on. I don�t know why these thoughts fester my mind. They haven�t done anything, that I know of, that has given me a reason to doubt them. There�s this part of me that wants to be the best of the best in their eyes: better than all their exes and previous partners. This includes personality, physical attractiveness, career, etc. The physical attractiveness is usually the one I�m most concerned about. I have some assumptions as to why I feel this way. I am riddled with negative thoughts about my appearance. I don�t like how I look and don�t really consider my self an attractive person. That�s (my face) not something I can change about myself. There�s this constant thought of not being enough for them and because of that maybe they�ll stray because I�m not enough for them to stay. Maybe if I�m the best, they�ll actually try to keep me� I know no one�s perfect and it�s not exactly possible to be the best at everything� but I can�t seem to get those thoughts out of my mind. Usually at the 2-3 month mark, it gets so bad to the point where I panic because I don�t think they�re interested in me as much anymore or I�ll nitpick at the things they say about me and make it out to be an attack on my appearance or just me in general. I�ll end this out of nowhere and without hesitation because I just want to stop feeling that way�. and maybe they�ll step forward and show me that they actually want me. This time around, I notice that my hand tremors have gotten more noticeable. I should�ve caught on that I�m more anxious than normal instead of dismissing it. When they don�t step up and �let things end�, I feel personally attacked and go into a spiral. I make myself the victim of the narrative because them just agreeing to me being �too sensitive for the relationship� or any other lame excuse I give, means that they personally think that way and that I�m too much for them to handle� I�m unwanted again� 

I have been cheated on and sexually assaulted in the past and that has a big influence on how I act now but I don�t know how to through this cycle of anxiety and panic�",-2
34,sad,"I (17F) have been living with a family friend(FF) and my mother for about 2 years now. Only recently, since quarantine started, have I become so uncomfortable with her I can barely handle being in the same room as her. 

She thinks I'm really irresponsible because I don't do my chores, but in reality I can't bring myself to do them when she's around. I got the vibe that she already dislikes me, which caused me to distance myself and not talk as much.
Pretty sure this has caused FF to dislike me even more till the point where she sometimes just glares at me.

This led to me becoming more and more uncomfortable around her to the point where I will only go downstairs to eat when she's not around and that I am now too uncomfortable to even go downstairs to leave the house. I know that when I go downstairs and she's there, I have to say something, but firstly I have no idea what to say to her and secondly I feel like whatever I say she's going to snap at me. Usually I end up just chickening out whenever I have to be in her presence and keep quiet, hoping she doesnt say anything to me as I dash past her. 

I've talked to my mother about this and she just says ""just get over it, you have to get over it"", but I don't know how. Can someone give me some advice on how I can handle this situation?

It seems everyone I know does. Also the way I look. I see my friends, they are beautiful and talented and smart and I feel not those things for myself.

38,sad,"I've been struggling with depression since I was like 10, and I'm 19 now. That's pretty fucked up how a kid should have to struggle with this extreme emotion. Depression doesn't discriminate, however. It doesn't give a fuck if something fantastic happened, when it strikes it makes any positive thing negative. I fucking hate it, I just want to know what it's like to feel good. I mean, for Christ's sake, I developed a drug habit to get away from it all. I stayed high all day to prevent myself from feeling anything at all. The weed made my depression worse, but at least I didn't fucking remember it afterwards. Cocaine made it all better, but who the fuck has time or money for a 30 minute high? The LSD usually sent me into a terrible trip. Nothing really helps. I'm on 2 mood stabilizers and an antidepressant and STILL feel like shit. I'm quickly losing hope. Almost half my life has been spent in the shitter. They say everything happens for a reason, but I seriously beg to differ. Fuck all the religious shit. In my understanding, there is no fucking all caring god. My opinion is that he doesn't give a shit about anyone. He sure doesn't care for me, at all. Give me some proof that a god exists, and I can guarantee that I can disprove it. There's so many things I hold resentment for, and religion is one of them. Sorry for this tangent, but I just feel really strongly about this subject. Main point, I'm fucking miserable and I'm goddamn tired of feeling this way.",-2
39,sad,"I hate being near other people unless i've known them for years, When people look at me I feel disgusted, I hate being looked at by other people I hate it when people gain knowledge on me or know anything about me, I don't interact with people unless it's unavoidable. I hate the feeling of other people, their hair brushing against me makes me cringe, their hands are too scratchy, their faces are too confusing, I don't hate people I just hate being near or physically interacting with people. Hair is especially disgusting, it collects grease, sweat, urine, and feces depending on the location of the hair, I would never order someone to change their appearance but I hate hair that isn't located on the head. 

I don't like to communicate to others either, I always feel unaccepted or like I am misunderstood, I also often misunderstand people, especially when it comes to sarcasm or instructions, I feel like I'm the only one who finds my sense of humor funny.

40,sad,"I am feeling like my spouse is emotionally detached from me and she does not care. I had a mental breakdown 4 -5 years ago and ended up in the hospital for 5 days. I feel something boiling in me and my wife is far from helping and all I need is her to say she�s here for me or hug me and actually mean it. I told her that her friends are more important with their feelings instead of mine. Her response is �they come to me and you don�t�. She�s right I should go to her but she stated early today that she enjoys being on her phone and it�s one of the little things that make her happy and I am not the person that wants to take joy away from others. She just can�t put the phone down. 

We have a child that�s 3 and I feel like the baby daddy. Mommy is the only one that makes her feel better. I work in retail and have my own business on the side. I wake up very early to start my business and when they get up I stop because I want to spend time with my family. I work retail on the weekends for extra money. 

My spouse doesn�t share anything with me anymore. She only asks me when she wants something. I�m just about to break and just need advice. 

By no means am I perfect. I can do a lot better with myself but all I�m wanting is to know that she cares but I am not sure I am going to get it.

41,sad,"This year has been so crazy, I honestly forgot it was my birthday in less than a month. There has been a lot of heartache and sadness that I guess I wasn�t even paying attention to it. 

I�ll be 20 and I honestly feel like I have nothing going on for me. I know that it�s normal to feel that way but it�s actually really making me feel so bad. Like I just can�t help but cry. I�m still living with my parents with no job, I�m not in school because I owe money, I do the same thing every single day. I had a job interview two weeks ago that actually went very well and I had a lot of hope. But I never got the call back and know that I didn�t get the job. I�ve been searching for two years now and had no luck. I want to continue to go to school to get my associates in nursing but I ended up withdrawing early in the semester so now I owe money that I don�t have. I�ve thought about maybe enlisting but at the same time I don�t know a whole lot about the military.

I know I am capable of changing my situation if I stopped whining and complaining about how rough life is, but I feel trapped and I�m just stuck where I am.

42,sad,"

Events that led up to the point: 

An extremely stressful morning of package handling (a package being signed and delivered to someone who was not me, and only half of another package coming in). The morning was full of stress and tears. 

After a couple hours of sleep my partner and I were having a discussion about why things were happening, and some comments were said that caused me to run away from the conversation very distraught and crying. (I have a history of self harm and two suicide attempts very recently). 

I was about to cut myself when my partner stopped me and hugged me, apologizing and talking to me. During the time my partner was talking to me I completely couldn't move. It felt like I wasn't even there in the room. I could feel myself semi present in my mind, but not in my body. I've never experienced this before and I didn't know what to do. I was still crying the whole time but not functioning any other way except for blinking. 

When I finally did come back I was very scared and backed away from my partner. I was trying to back away from the situation because of how scared and confused I was. After coming back I cried very hard and was shaking quite a lot in my legs. 

Please someone tell me what happened!! Please help me understand what I experienced, and maybe even why I experienced it.. Thank you so much for your time and help.",-2
43,sad,"Long-story short: I'm at a point in my life I've never been at before. I literally don't give a shit about anything anymore. I could lose my job, I don't care. I could never eat again, I don't care. I just don't care about anything right now. Constant anxiety attacks, crying all the time. I'm not doing well and I know it. I'm actually a little scared - so I did reach out to my doctor but things are so busy right now that I can't be seen right now. 

I have a new adopted puppy. He came before all the shit hit the fan (just before) and I like him but I can't handle him. He's crazy, he's destructive, he doesn't settle. He needs constant around the clock training and I CAN'T. I find no joy in being with him right now. He's a chore. I'm so mad at him 95% of the time and it ISN'T HIS FAULT. I feel like a horrible person. I actually hate myself for not being able to bond and invest in him. 

Everyone just keeps saying to be patient and give him time. Nobody understands that I have zero patience in me right now. ""He'll settle when he's older."" I know that... but he's only 10 months and he's out of control. I don't know what the hell I was thinking. I think I was just so desperate for love after I lost my dog and this pup is wonderful. It's all me... It's all my failures, my faults. 

My ex fucked me over so I had to cancel the vet appointment to get his shots and now they're booking into late August/Sept which means puppy classes are pushed back. I can't even get him fucking medical care and his shots and learn how to work with him. I'm just done. I don't think there's much more I can take.",-2
44,sad,"I was bullied for 7 years and I was constantly kicked, punched, and shoved. My best friend beat me up and I was raped by a girl I had a thing with when I was 12. That�s basically sums up some reasons why I can�t stop flinching. I flinch when people walk in front of me or come up behind my back when I had school. I would flinch when I saw somebody enter the classroom or bathroom. My friends scared me a lot by coming up and grabbing my shoulders which reminded me of the time I got raped, and that would make me flinch. I would even flinch when I saw a person come up to me in a video game, even in a video game where I knew that person in front of me wasn�t real. I want to stop flinching because it�s so embarrassing when I do it in the hallways and people just sort of stare and I always end up saying sorry even though I did nothing wrong. I hate when my family touches me and my sister who is a few inches taller than me just sort of stands in front of me sometimes and that makes me scream and flinch.

I'm 17 years old - so close to moving out and I guess ""starting"" my life - but I just feel like everything is falling apart. My relationship with my parents has never been great. I've dealt with the guilt tripping and berating and trash-talking my whole life and fully intend to cut them off once I move out and have intended to since I understood what that meant. Since lockdown has started, it's only gotten worse, and I feel so ridiculously miserable. I never want to be home, and my parents don't want me home either, but I have to be. I don't know why I've started feeling so miserable. My life had gotten really good at the beginning of lockdown, if only briefly - I had great relationships with my friends and had just gotten a boyfriend (whom I am still with and love very much) - but now I just feel so fatigued and hopeless. It feels as if it's not even worth trying to get out of bed most days. I don't know what I want to do after high school. I'm not particularly good at anything and my grades are average at best. I don't know what college I want to go to and I don't even know if it matters anymore since the world seems to be falling to pieces (at least in America). It's tiring having to deal with my parents and my friends. It's tiring having to think about my own future and about everything going wrong around me.

The job I have now is boring to the point where my thoughts are only filled with negative things. As much as I want to break from it I don't know how.

I thought moving would help me escape the environment that I had those thoughts but I was completely wrong. I just made it worse for myself. I stress about money mostly, I want to be successful but the motivation is completely gone. I work with people in their 30s-40s that have been working at this retail store for most of their life and that just scares me to think that I could become that if I don't do something that pays well, but at the same time I cannot stop doubting my potential. I don't even believe I have potential anymore. I know that the only person that can make you great is yourself, but when you're mind is driving you out of existence what can you do besides finding a counselor or therapist? I have no money for counseling or any sort of therapist. I would take prescriptions but half the time those just make it worse.

56,sad,"Legitimately every time I make a big and important plan it goes wrong or never comes to fruition no matter how much I try.
I'm anxious constantly. The pain from my trauma affects me every day. I live in emotional agony. 
I've been trying to get on SSI for a year now and I have no other income. I've tried to work but I sincerely just can't do it. Even 9 hours a week total was seriously pushing it for me. And that's not enough to live off of on minimum wage. But I can't survive without money.
I feel so alone and alienated. I don't understand people. I don't understand why money keeps me and so many other people like me from the basic things we need. Housing, food, water, clothing. It's kept from us unless we can pay and keep the pockets of some rich bastard fat and happy.

I can't survive in this world. I don't think I was meant to. I don't want to go to the hospital or the doctor anymore. I used to, but for what? So they can give me a pill and tell me to find a way to cope with the feelings that are left? Ignoring the material issues. Such as how I can't survive without money. I am tired of struggling to recover, only to be hit with a new blow and falling down all over again. I'm really tired of it. I don't see a point, because this is going to be how the rest of my life is. Struggling to get by for another day, another week, another month, another year. Struggling to survive but never living. That's how my life has always been and whenever I have tried to change it or to end this cycle, it gets worse.

I moved in with some long time friends across the country and instead of finding stability like they'd said I learned one of them is an offending pedophile and the other is an emotionally abusive stalker. I came back to my hometown and was only able to afford it from the stimulus check and selling a lot of my stuff. I was stuck there for 8 months total and spent the last half of them in constant terror, genuinely fearing for my life.

I don't have family that support me. I'm trans and gay, and I ran away from an abusive home when I was 19. Even if I tried to come back to them to beg for help my life would get worse.

I had been planning for half a year now to move into public housing with my partner. Because that's been my dream. To make a family, have that sort of stability and belonging that I've never had. The application came in the mail. My partners abusive grandmother had previously said she would pay for his plane ticket here, and reimburse him for some other things. Since the application came in she's been flip flopping on paying it and now yesterday she's decided that instead of paying to get him to move here, she'll pay his way through college, something he had never expressed interest in. He's in the same boat as me, wanting to try to get on SSI. I've seen him struggle with working. I've seen him struggle just in general. 

She isn't offering this out of kindness or a desire to educate him, she's doing it for the same reason she's been flip flopping. I know exactly how she is. Both of us do but he's just... Accepting it and I don't understand. She wants to keep him under her control. That's all it is. If she was genuinely interested in furthering his education, and he was genuinely interested in pursuing it, there's no reason he wouldn't be able to go to college here, in a college town, in a state much better and a town much better than where he is. He'd be locked there for at least four years. But he said he kind of wants to do it, and that it doesn't matter if she backs down. This doesn't make any sense to me anymore. Nothing does. But why should I be surprised anymore, because this is always how shit goes for me. I have been trying so hard to get his paperwork settled and to save up money for him to come since she refused to pay, we have been planning this for half a year. And now it's just not happening. I'm devastated and I'm tired of my dreams being trampled on because I'm broke and can't work. I'm tired of this world.",-3

It started when I was talking to this dude- on of the first guys if not the first that I�ve ever romantically talked to (I�m closeted). Things were wonderful and we had such good relationship by my situation and distance made us end it.

Then multiple times they expressed continued sexual interest me. They don�t express interest in a relationship, just sexual. It hurt. It hurts. I�m seeing them next week with friends. Idk how to navigate it.

It�s not just this dude. It�s a lot of stuff. I never thought of myself as attractive until I got to university and started getting catcalled and got stalked around a gym. I don�t like feeling this way especially when I don�t see myself this way because of my body dysmorphia. Sometimes I just feel like wearing baggy clothes and a hat and my glasses to avoid feeling this way and other days I feel like posting on social media just because I feel like it�s the only way to get attention.

Idk if this sounds dumb. I hope not, because I�m really struggling with my self image and how to navigate this and....idk how to deal. Just some advice. I just feel like I�ll never be able to find someone who likes me for me that I also like. Further compounded by my familial situation forcing me to keep my identity hidden.",-1
59,sad,"Does anyone else say they�re going to do something and then when that time comes, you can�t find the strength to stick to your word?

Like, I�ve been trying to take a month break from smoking marijuana to see if it improves my mental health. But when I get home from work, I end up convincing myself that �smoking isn�t the issue� or �you can start your break tomorrow� etc. 

How come I can�t see the benefit of staying clean when I�m at home? Every day I convince myself that I can still smoke weed whereas when I�m at work, I tell myself that I need to quit.

60,sad,"Just to preface, before I began experiencing these feelings, I was always someone into philosophy. I knew there were many philosophers who discussed some dark stuff, but I paid little attention. However, in the past 4 months I've fallen into this rabbit hole of philosophical pessimism, anti-natalism, misanthropy, and pro-extinction movements. After reading this stuff my world view suffered dramatically.

Every day I feel anxious and angry that I am alive. I keep having dark thoughts that my sentience is a burden and my parents were cruel and selfish for having me. Just the other day I saw some children playing outside with their parents. Something as innocent as that to me felt evil because their parents subjected their children to unimaginable amounts of pain and suffering without their consent. I felt the best thing to do was to hope the family had a quick and painless death all at once to spare them from suffering. After that, I felt my chest tighten and my feet went cold. That feeling has been periodically coming and going the past week.

When I write that this is a feedback loop, I mean it in the sense that I feel a strong compulsion to keep reading these ideas even though I am aware of how much pain they're causing me. I canceled plans because I was reading Ligotti's ""Conspiracy Against the Human Race"" which put me into a state was almost like a breakdown but not quite; yet I couldn't stop reading. I really don't want to believe these ideas anymore but they feel like irrefutable and universal truths. I don't know how to help myself",-2

I also told my boss a coworker has been trying to get close to me after almost a year of telling this coworker that I will not date him, will not be his friend.
He�s got a neckbeard type of personality.

I�m so anxious I don�t even want to be seen let alone go to work and be a cashier and be stuck there for 9 hrs. Sometimes men harass me for being friendly, sometimes people get mad I stopped being friendly.
I called in sick so many times I can�t afford to stay home today. But I just hate people, don�t want to be seen, feel sick af, and so I just want to die.
I just hate that I have to go anywhere let alone deal with trying to be nice to a bunch of idiot customers.

If I�m dead I don�t have to go anywhere!",-3
62,sad,"I've got a Bipolar 2 and anxiety diagnosis, and for years have struggled with paranoid thoughts of thinking no one likes me and assuming that whenever I am not around, people are talking about me. I will point out; I am completely aware that it is a ridiculous thought and the world does not revolve around me. However I can never shake the feeling, especially at work. I always assume when I leave my office or if I hear anyone talking behind closed doors when I am around, that it is a conversation about how obnoxious, stupid, unliked, etc. I am. 

Even people in my personal life, such as my fiance's family who I have never had an issue with. I am constantly worried that they do not like me and do not approve of my engagement, despite them never saying a negative word about it.

I know I am far from the only person who experiences this, so my question is, what have you done to successfully cope and/or move past this? It is so exhausting.",-1
63,sad,"I failed the practical part for one of my modules which was worth 60% of the grade. I cannot cope with anymore failure. I have already repeated a year at university due to depression and have been on sertraline for the last 2 years. I have been a failure all my life. I cannot defend myself from abuse, my parents force me give private tuitions to the neighbors kids for �5 an hour, I cannot have a girlfriend nor have sex because of my ultra conservative parents. We are now moving into a new house where I have to a share a bedroom with my younger brother anymore. I feel like killing myself and I cannot cope with failure anymore",-3
64,sad,"I hate the fact that I�m unattractive and I put people off. I get told that it�s my energy but it�s obviously my looks. I�m sick of trying to put makeup on and still look ridiculous. I also have a feeling that I�ll be forever alone because I�m shy and can�t keep up a conversation or whoever I�m matched with just wants my nudes. One of my biggest fears is rejection so I don�t even try anymore.

I just wish that I was confident, but I�ve been traumatized by the humiliation I received at school and work everyday. Constantly reminding me on how unattractive I am and that no ones gonna take me seriously. Strangers would take a look at me and laugh. It shattered my self confidence and made me hate myself even more. I became more awkward and hyper self aware. It�s hard for me to relax and not feel tensed up, even when I�m alone. No amount of therapy will make me accept my looks. TMI but the constant harassment I dealt with caused me to not shower as often and I ended up picking at my skin. Which caused me to have a lot of acne scars. I just stopped caring about how I looked because I would still look hideous regardless so why bother?

I just wish I had the money to get a nose job and get rid of the face fat that I have. I hate that I wasted my youth being depressed because the stress is showing on my face and I�m aging fast. I have dark circles, hyperpigmentation, a big wide nose and face, have wide hips but no ass, just a plain mess. I�m only 18 yet my body is getting weaker everyday and I easily lose my balance. I feel like disgusting trash and honestly killing me. I used to be suicidal over this but now I just internalize it because there�s nothing I can do about it",-3
65,sad,"So i think my friend was about to kill himself yesterday because he gave me and other people in the friend group a good bye message on discord and omg I cried so much, I�ve recently been numb for a while so when I saw that message I panicked badly (kinda shit that the only way I feel is extreme sadness) I kept on crying because he is one of my best friends, and I don�t think I�d live with myself if he died. I called my friends and we almost called the police before he texted us back saying he needed some space, we decided to give him his space however I�ve felt on edge all day with this pit in my stomach waiting for something bad to happen, I�m scared he might have said that just so he can kill himself and idk what to do. I wanna make sure he�s safe. Idk how. However if he only wants space then maybe when I start checking up on him he might get annoyed and do something out of anger. I�ve had my sister attempt before and I had to call the ambulance or else she would have died, Idk if my friends are feeling this anxious or if it�s due to me experiencing this before.",-1
66,sad,"This summer has been especially tough for me between being locked down for COVID and being out of a job. Not only that but I�m back living with my parents until I can go back to school which is triggering because most of my memories in this house include depression, anxiety, and disordered eating. I�ve been talking to my family about how I wish I could go back to work coaching gymnastics or that I had literally anything to do right now and I always get the same response of how jealous they are of me and mocking me saying �oh your life is so hard, you poor thing. All you have to do is lay in the pool all day�. They know I have a history of mental health issues but they really just don�t understand. They don�t understand that the reason I sleep in all day is because I either don�t have the energy to get up or that I would rather be asleep than face being alive. Having things like school or work and having structure is the only thing that keeps me going and in an okay headspace and now that�s all gone and I feel like I have no purpose and nothing to live for. Especially my sister mocks me a lot, and she�ll go on to say things like �I�m depressed today� when she�s just in a funk and I feel like it really belittles the experience I�m having. It just makes me feel more helpless that she�ll never actually understand.",-2
67,sad,"For about 9 months I have felt really down cyclically. I feel really, deeply sad/low/down and just can't stop crying and get over my sadness. Then I spend a few days feeling incrementally better, and then a few weeks of feeling really good! I add new routines into my life, start working hard and excitedly towards my dreams and start socialising. Those few weeks feel really nice and I wish they could last forever. Sometimes after this period I just feel fine and normal rather than really good and really excited/motivated. Usually I just go from feeling great to suddenly feeling really down. Anything can trigger this. Small things will deeply upset and bother me. I feel unable to regulate myself at the moment. I tell myself I'm just over-dramatic and self-indulgent and that I'm a silly 18 year old that likes to think she has problems and is just too sensitive. I don't know. Life sucks. I'm starting to dread feeling good because it always goes bad and then I feel even worse because things were going well.

I can�t �end it� (despite trying) until my mum passes away (because I dont want her to know) but shes healthy and well.

70,sad,"My masters degree ends in a month, I�m completely lost and my support network dissipated with covid. I don�t think I can do it- when my anxiety gets bad my connection between my head and my body just cuts off. I can�t make my hands do anything when I�m panicking and my degree is in drawing and painting.

Since March I�ve had 1 hour of time with my lecturers, I lost my studio, changed home, lost my job and am paying full tuition. I�ve done all I can to change these circumstances and can�t affect any change.

The first doctor says I am showing signs of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and an eating disorder, and that I will most likely be given medication. There is only one problem: I'm scared.

I'm scared of being changed by the medicine. I've been like this for as long as I can remember. Will I be changed? I've been told some side effects of medication is a shorter temper, worse depression, or being completely changed personality wise. I dont want to be changed, I want to say me. Help",-1
72,sad,"So I�ve had mental health problems for as long as I can remember. Since I was 16 (now 25) I�ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and most recently, psychosis. The psychosis side of things has calmed down quite significantly due to medication but my depression and anxiety flare up all the time.

On Monday I had a bad flare up with my depression. I�d been alone for the majority of the day (live with mum and brother) and I was bored, like to the point it was really getting me down, sounds stupid I know.. like why not just do something? Well there was nothing to do, I don�t have friends, my boyfriend was out with his friends and I had no motivation to do anything anyway, that�s when the bad thoughts started creeping in.

So it got to about 7pm and at this point I�d had enough of being on my own, feeling worthless, nobody to talk to and the thing that overtook my thoughts the most was to take an OD. I�ve had this thought many many times before but I�ve never acted on it but that night I was soo close. I started crying uncontrollably and couldn�t think of anything else apart from to hurt myself, so started punching myself in the head. Better than killing myself right? (It�s Wednesday now and my head still hurts from the blows). I also downed a fair bit of vodka at this point too.

My boyfriend came over that night and soothed me until I fell asleep. 

Yesterday we went out for the day and I had so much fun, we went to a local pet store just to look at the animals and my mind felt so clear for the first time in a long time. 

I can�t help thinking about Mondays events though and it makes me feel bad again, I haven�t told my mum about it all because I don�t want to upset or anger her. 

Anyway, just wanted to vent and ask for some advice on what you think I should do.. contact my doctor? Therapy? Idk, but I forgot to mention that I was supposed to have a telephone therapy appointment on Thursday and nobody got in contact with me about it so I don�t feel like I�m supported that way.

I either feel that or nothing at all and I can't help but wonder when will the next high be, when will the next low be? Will it finally be the low that I begin hurting myself again? Will it be the low I finally take it a step further and end it all? I can't stand being so out of control of everything in my life with nobody by my side. Everything seems to be stacked against me and every solution I fight tooth and nail for fails. I can't help this constant hell loop over gotten in and I wonder why does my brain do this to me?

75,sad,"I would like to hear how others deal with the feeling of a strong desire for something. 

I am sorry for all negativity as described below. There are also a lot of beautiful moments in our household, but in this post I am mainly venting and describing the negative aspects.

My boyfriend and I want to move out into an apartment for ourselves. We live in a dysfunctional household with my brothers and one parent. We have been actively searching for a place for the last 7 months, but it�s extremely hard to find a place as a starter without paying a ridiculously amount of money. We�ve been to two house viewings but every time we�re the third or fifth in line or so. Finding a new place is definitely getting closer, and I know we will find a nice home eventually, but I feel like it is taking too long. I feel like I am utterly powerless. We apply for like 20 places every week and it is exhausting. I frustrate myself daily about all horrible aspects of our household: the mess everywhere, no one cleans their own shit, my brothers who live completely in their own word (severe mental health problems), my father who wants to move on with his life and girlfriend but cannot do that due to many reasons.. the atmosphere is often terrible and I wouldn�t even call it a �household�.

I love my family and if I could I would fix their problems, but unfortunately I cannot. I have enough things I�m struggling with myself. I just want to move on with my lovely boyfriend and keep a greater distance to everyone else�s shit and depressing moods. I�ve had various breakdowns the last few months (especially due to quarantaine). I know once I move it I am never moving in again in the house I grew up in. So I try to make the most of the time left living in this house. I am sure the connection between me and my brothers/father will become better once we have our own place. But I just don�t want to wait any longer. It is so exhausting to go to the house viewings, becoming really excited for the nice place and hopefull again, and then not being the candidate to have the home assigned to.

Please tell me how you deal with feelings like these.",-1
77,sad,"Like most people here i personally don�t like me, and to be completely honest I hate almost everything about myself. I think I might be mentally ill and I frankly don�t know what to do about it. I was physically abused a lot as a kid and preteen and my abusive parents got into a nasty divorce. Both of them tried manipulating me and unfortunately both succeeded although one much more so than the other. Because of this I was forced to lie for me and my siblings �well-being� to mental health professionals as well cps and the such. I believe there was a period where I was seriously depressed but I received no help, and I somehow got through it??? Although I�m fairly certain I�m not depressed anymore I now have and have had these seemingly random outbursts of extreme rage/sadness and just straight up breakdowns. The rage is especially hard to handle as it�s quite hard to control myself during it. For example, when I was 14 my mom said something just awful to me which I�d normally be able to handle but my immediate instinct was to stab myself twice in the chest with a small pocket knife. Throughout all of this I think I might have anxiety despite the fact I really don�t know what it even is, I just feel so tense at all times as if there was a pane of glass in my chest that someone was is trying to bend it. I genuinely don�t know what to think and just want a second opinion as I have been told I like stuff being wrong with me.",-2

79,sad,I havent been doin so good. I just finished group therapy for traumatized youth about 2 weeks ago. It was originally a 8 week program but corona made it a 5 month one. I started in January and it helped so much the only issue was i felt real excluded at first. Everyone from the original group i was in ended up leaving. Except for one. She actually signed up for more weeks. She was incredibly direct and gave great insight on lots of issues. She helped me get over being absolutely heartbroken about my ex. She was struggling with drug addiction and family issues. Overtime i started to feel for her. Which after last year i thought id never do but thanks to her help she just so happend to be the first person i fell for. But sadly once corona happend we stopped talking. Because the rule in the program i was stated that you cant have outside relationships with other members until after you finished the program. Fast forward to around june 9th. They opened it back up with limited hours. I was so happy to see her again. Only to heat that she started doing drugs again after just getting clean. And that she wouldnt be coming back. I finished the program and never got to see her again. Im worried for her. And i wanna make sure she gets help. I wanna see her again. Even if she is jsut a friend. A part of me is scared i i try tho shell just hate me. And i cant even try if i wanted . I dont know any of her social medias or number.,-1
80,sad,"Started on them a month ago and the first side effects were severe migraine with brain fog, tight chest, numbness/weakness in lower right leg and waking up 3 hours after I fell asleep every single night. 
Side effects lasted around 2 weeks, apart from the tight chest which continued to come and go. 
On week 3, my dose got doubled and the tight chest and waking up too early stuff came back. 
The breathing is especially troubling as we are in the middle of a pandemic and I already suffer with health anxiety. 
Otherwise, I�m pretty level, no more thoughts about doing anything... �dark� and I�m much calmer overall.

81,sad,"Disclaimer on trigger phases!!!


So I (20F) have this weird i guess habit, I�m not sure what to call it, where if thoughts about something I regret or feel guilty about in the past memories start playing then the only way to stop them is by saying out loud �I want to kill myself� to stop them. To be clear I don want to harm myself currently but I did at some point in my life. Lucky I got myself out of that darkness but I have this now weird habit. The images of the regrettable memory or traumatic memory literally don�t stop and just grow with negative emotion unless I say that phase. Idk what it is much less explain it without sounding weird. I want to definitely explain it to some one professionally but I�m terrified they�ll say that I do want to somehow harm myself and that�s not the case. I just hate that sometimes the memory show up out of no where but are a bit constant and I usually have to deal it the emotions until I say the phase. I�ve tried saying something else to stop them but nothing seems to satisfying my brain unless that�s along the previous mention phase.

I�m not looking for advice or answer I just felt like venting out my thoughts on my mental status. (Of course feel free to give opinion)

82,sad,"Hi redditors,

I (f 30) feel like I'm losing my sanity in my current relationship with my bf (28) of a little over 2 years.

I am highly emotional and he has depression and, I and his brother suspect, some narcissistic tendencies. We moved in together last fall and all hell broke lose. We both had trouble adjusting and all expectations fell short. I ended up going to therapy because I felt my emotions were the root of all trouble and I discovered a lot about myself and about how to control my emotions, although of course it's a work in progress. 

I have since started journaling to further explore where emotional overreactions may stem from and what situations trigger me. I feel much more balanced and more often than not am able to put negative mindsets aside in order to focus on healing and passion in my life. 

My bf struggles very hard to recognize the progress I am making and is extremely sensitive - understandably - to situations that have led me to ""explode"" in the past. In his eyes, I'm a monster who's responsible for ruining his life, he starts attacking me as a ""prevantative measure"" and claims he ""was right about my all along"" should I react poorly to him calling me names, telling me I was retarded and didn't deserve to be loved etc. 

Since Corona started he has been admittedly extra sensitive due to the restrictions, but he still claims every little spat is my fault, interpretes everything I do as an attack on him and tells me I deserve to be treated this way for being such a horrible human being. Anything nice I do for him, any affection I show him becomes worthless in his eyes, because eventually we will start fighting again, which makes me ""a liar for being nice to him even though I visciously wanted to make his life miserable"".

Lately I'm noticing some aggression from my side towards him when he attacks me for having feelings and belitteling me. He doesn't recognize that his behaviour is part of this vicious cycle where we emotionally abuse each other and every day it's getting more difficult to detach myself from these feelings of aggression. Today I even slapped him after he called me a name, and even though we had a calm conversation after and I know both sides were extremely aggressive, I feel horrible for not being able to control myself.

My ressources for stabilizing my mental health seem to be failing at the moment and I wonder if anybody might share some wisdom from similar experiences?

I am really struggling to carry this relationship on my shoulders, but I still feel like I'm very far from being able to end it. I'd appreciate any thoughts or ressources that could help me gain balance, perspective and emotional strength to not engage in this toxic cycle.

84,sad,"Why is it when I get depressed I start to hate my house and want to move out? 

I've done it with the last few houses I've lived in and it's happening again, and I hate it. This house is crappy but livable. Decent space, a few problems with damp but that's it. We can't afford to move anywhere just yet, as we are trying to save a deposit to buy, so I know I'm stuck here, but I just hate it. I spend days crying over the fact that I'm living in this crappy house. My husband is fine with the house, he isn't bothered by the problems. 

I also have a little bit of a hoarding problem, as I am way too emotionally attached to objects. It's not full on hoarding, my house isn't falling on top of me, I just have a fair bit of clutter and boxes of stuff stored in the loft. I'm working on getting rid of it but when I'm depressed I flick between wanting to keep everything and wanting to throw it all in a skip. 

Anyone else go through anything similar? Any advice?",-1
85,sad,"It sound weird, but it just occurred to me last night that for the whole of this very stressful year, I haven't pulled the duvet over me, plumped my pillows or hell, even properly made my bed (I've changed it, I just haven't put much effort into making it a comfortable place to rest). And this got me thinking about how I've been approaching this year in general.

It's been a tough year both worldly and personally and I have been making very solid attempts at being more happy with myself and moving up in life. I've been going through each day like it's simply just a stepping stone onto the next, and I haven't made attempts to make myself comfortable in the moment. Sleeping isn't a time to relax anymore, it's a process I need to get through in order to reach tomorrow. 

I feel like I can't experience comfort as the things which used to give my head comfort now just give me stress and what will perhaps give me peace of mind in the future, I currently don't posses.

So I don't know. I don't miss what used to give me peace of mind as it was ultimately negative, but now I'm left in a strange transition spot in my life and I'm just jumping from one day to the next. Sorry if this 
was too in cohesive to follow or if it seems arbitrary.

I hope you all have a fantastic day by the way, much love to you all",-1
86,sad,"I find it hard to switch myself out of certain moods, specifically negative ones.

For example, my brother was late to dinner with my family tonight. This slightly upset my mother, which in turn greatly upset me. My mom was able to drop it but I wasn�t, even though I tried.

I spent the rest of the night upset and was not talkative, it made the dinner less pleasant than it could�ve been and I might as well not have even been there. I feel bad but it�s almost that my emotions are out of control.

This is one example but this always happens, once I start feeling upset or negative it seems like the thoughts are a one-way train with no breaks. I tried to excuse myself, take some deep breaths and I recognized that I don�t need to feel this way and my emotions are a choice, but it didn�t change my mood, it never does.

I don�t like this, I don�t like feeling negative, how can I get myself to �snap out� of a funk like this when I enter one?",-1
87,sad,"I've tried focusing on the good things in my life, distracting myself, there aren't many good things right now and the reality important things are going to shit. I'm so tired of feeling bad, I can't go to therapy right now, does anyone have advice?",-1
88,sad,"I�ve always doubted myself and relied on my friends/SO�s to help me through my tough times. I developed this habit through my parents divorce 4-6 years ago (it took 2 years for the whole process). With quarantine and not being around my friends and being home from university, I haven�t talked to my friends from school all that much. My friends from high school are here, but I wasn�t (and still not) close enough to talk about my issues with them. I never really was in with the group, so I relied on my SO�s.

My SO broke up with me about 2 weeks ago, and I just feel so empty now. I still talk to them everyday because they said they�d would still want to be friends (they weren�t in the right mental space, and I was too dependent) and I�d rather not lose my best friend as well as my SO. So I�ve been trying to not talk about my problems, and without them or being around my friends from school, I just feel so alone. I have a full time job over the summer, but it�s WFH and I�m alone the entire workday, and then I usually just stay in my room the rest of the day. 

Although they said I can always come to them if I need help, I�m not going to burden my ex like that. I still love them so much, and I�d never want to hurt them by adding to their problems. This makes me feel stuck because I feel like I don�t have anyone to talk about my problems with. I won�t tell my parents about my problems because my sister has some mental health problems, and they�re worried about her, and I don�t want my parents to be worried about me.

All of this loneliness combined with the person I love not even having feelings (they�re trying to suppress their feelings until they�re gone, and they already are/almost gone) makes me feel empty. I feel like I never win in life. I always lose. I thought about killing myself about 5 (ish?) years ago: I laid on my side in the bath tub and said whichever side I fall on is what happens. Now, I know I can�t kill my self. It�s selfish, rude, un-empathetic, I�m too much of a coward to do it, and it�d crush my sister, parents, and my ex. I�m also scared to die, there�s too much that�s unknown and I hate not knowing things.

I�ve scheduled an appointment with a therapist, but it�s in a week, and I want to improve myself because I very well know that I need to. I just really don�t want to be here right now. I want to just vanish in a Thanos snap, and then come back when everything is better. I�m sorry for the rant, it was probably a waste of your time to read it.

Anyways, it turns out I was being screened for ADHD since 5th grade and I finally at age 31 sought out my own diagnosis for adhd. This either was hidden from me or my parents forgot. Teachers raised concerns since childhood and into high school that it was possible that I had adhd. By the time I got to college it was too late. The anxiety and stress of undiagnosed ADHD made me go crazy and a doctor diagnosed me with schizophrenia instead. I feel blindsided and I feel that my parents let me down. I feel like my teachers and school psychologists let me down. Why the hell did it take 31 years to figure this out? Why did everyone including the doctors leave it up to me to figure out? I�m so damn smart I eventually figured it out on my own and sought official diagnosis but someone along the way should have stepped up. This changes everything. I love my parents but they fucked up big time. My grade school teachers and counselors fucked up big time. I don�t know how to come to terms with this. Everything that I�ve questioned over w years and everything I�ve gone through now makes sense. I�m seeing a counselor next week but it�s going to be hard until then. I live with my parents currently due to corona",-1
92,sad,"I get really bad anxiety about small things. I constantly try and follow the crowd and hide my thoughts, but I�m a very vocal person and try to talk about things but then just get scared I�ll say the wrong thing. I have signs of autism and various mental health issues. I�ve tried to talk to my mom about it but when I say anything about having anxiety she just says to stop worrying and it�s all in my head and nothings wrong. I know my fears and anxiety�s are probably irrational but I can�t help feeling this way. I don�t know how to talk about it to her. She always makes me second guess anything and so I don�t want to go to a doctor for a diagnosis and have nothing wrong and then she�ll be mad and say im a hypochondriac again. She says this because i will say the same problem over and over again(that she never helps me withhh) Whenever I start shaking my hands or fidgeting with something or kinda shaking my legs as I do when I get vary anxious she gives me a weird look and says to stop. Apparently my anxiety�s are all about how I�m just worried about my future(they are not all about that) So I just don�t know what to do. I�m a 14yo female girl and when I�m around even my friends or at church I get scared I�m acting weird or look weird which are normal insecurities so I tell my self not to care but during this quarantine I have know where to escape too. During a well-check at the doctors is there any paper or something I can write on so my mom dosent see and the doctor can just make an assessment so my mom doesn�t get mad and know I wrote anything? Is there any sort of form just for the child? I know my mom won�t actually get mad but she�ll say I lied and just want attention and am a hypochondriac. I just want some way to talk to her or something without getting in trouble. Please give me some advice.

And please don�t misunderstand my mom is great and treats me well and feeds me and stuff but she is turning into a boomer about mental health because �it�s just a trend and nobody has actual depression or anxiety. All these teens are just trying to be trendy. When I was a kid no one heard of mental health issues.� ..ya because you all lived in a world without anything to worry about. And she also says it�s because of teens spending to much time on phones(which is my main source of happiness) Thankyou for listening to me for once and helping me. 

Edit: I�m sorry, I forgot to add what some of my main other mental issues are: 1. I either feel emotions way to much and heavily or just don�t feel any. 2. I procrastinate about even getting up to go to the bathroom, answer a question or reply in a conversation. 3. I just wanna be alone a lot and like playing video games or be in the dark and apparently that�s very weird for a young girl and I�m an extrovert apparently so I shouldn�t like that. 4. I have a lot of black spots in my memory�s and forget things like going into the bathroom and realize I just left or things like that. And finally 5. I definitely have ocd because I make my bed and nope remake. Again. Again. Nobody can sit on it or you have to remake it and have a panic attack. No make it again. Don�t put the shirt there. Put it there. Pick it up. Put it down. Up down up down. And so on. That�s all sorry.",-2
93,sad,"

Today was mentally the hardest days ive gone through. Ever. Nothing particularly bad happened. I was just lost in my mind. I just worked at a job i hate. Ive been recently having thoughts like ""what am i living for? I have no purpose and no one needs me."" and today those kind of thoughts were overwhelming. I was very short tempered , i didnt care. Before i left work i just left it a mess and clocked out. This was obviously careless and now with a clear head i feel bad for leaving like that. I just wanted to go home and hide under the blankets. Living feels like a chore to me. I recently lost both of my dogs due to my living situation. For a long time i would tell myself i live for them. Because they needed me. Something needed me. I loved them so much. I dont really have friends, i have a roommate whos really important to me but hes out of town a lot and i dont want to stress him . So when hes out of town, i seem to explode. and i dont like burdening my family especially when ive been told my mental problems aren't that bad. Im aware that im not homeless or starving but everyday still hurts inside my head. I always leave it inside, my feelings, because i dont see them as important anymore. 

When i got home i just laid in bed and sobbed quietly. I cant even describe the feeling. I just shut down after a bit. Laying there lifelessly. Then i had the urge to get into the bathtub. With my clothes on and warm warm water. It felt nice. I felt so cold and then so warm. I was in a trance, and these thoughts did not stop. I kept thinking about how tired i was and how i had no one to call , no one to turn to. Ive had several friends leave me because im too much for them. Another reason why I hold everything in. Venting made me lose important people. While in the tub i thought of those no longer in my life. I thought about what our last memory would be together. I wondered if theyd care if i turned up dead. I let the water go over my face and in a weird way, i felt at peace. I stayed under for a bit, the water spilled over and i didnt care. 

I then remembered that i had called my dad earlier that day, and that he might come over. I immediately sat up and started crying uncontrollably over the thought of my dad finding my body there. I remember not calling my mom for help because she was mad at me. I had to remember that even if i felt alone, my parents do love me unconditionally. In a way my dad pulled me out of that trance. I remembered my roommate too, how he'd have to deal with that. I felt so weird and i couldnt stop crying. 

I eventually got out of the tub, changed into dry clothes. I didnt feel that much better though. My roommate called to see how i was doing. One thing i love about him is how he checks up on me. I didnt tell him everything often but i did talk to him. He listened and let me cry a little and talked to me the best he could. I know its hard for people, and him, to give advice on touchy subjects like that but what matters most to me is that he was there and he tried. He was busy but called me a few times throughout the day to make sure i was okay. 

I also went to my mom's. Made a few comments that raised concern and made my mom cry. I didnt mean to, i usually stay quiet about these things because my mom tends to blame herself and i dont want her to do that. I don't want to be the cause of her unhappiness just because im unhappy. I know she loves me, i know my dad loves me, i know my roommate cares about me. Eveb if its just three people , thats okay right? That's enough. Im just so scared of being alone. I dont know where i was going with this post. I originally wanted to know why i did what i did. Why did i want to be in the tub? I wasnt intentionally thinking about suicide , but like i said-- i went into this like trance i just didnt care and i wanted it to stop. I don't think i wanted to kill myself, but that felt close, the closest ive ever been and im so scared of myself. 

I just don't know what to do now. I feel better- not cured but okay. I feel okay. Im proud of myself for making it through today. Im here and i did it. 

Comments, questions, resources and advice are all welcome. Again i think i wanted to vent or just tell my story. Maybe understand why i had that urge to be underwater. I don't know.",-1
94,sad,"i�m really stressed right now. my dads dying of cancer, i have upcoming surgery, i�m coming to realize my boyfriend and i aren�t a good match anymore and i�m terrified. i�m afraid i�m going to hurt myself. i don�t want to but idk what else to do .",-1
95,sad,"Soooo to give some backround, I'm a 19m in California and my life hasn't been the best in regards to what I value if that makes sense. Growing up I was a little chubby and shy, which lead to me being treated like shit and being bullied all the way till graduation. My family is toxic and value money over real relationships.

I have been alone my entire life and only had some distant friends here and there, no one close and no dating experience. I had no hobbies or interest for the first 18 years of my life. I would come home play video games go on YouTube rinse repeat for 19 years. I have probably gone out to hang out with people maybe 10 times my entire life. 

I am so fucking lonely and just want friends and a girlfriend for a wholesome relationship. I was in a suicidal depression from ages 14 to 19 and didn't tell a single person and no one knows still. my entire life I have tried to be a kind respectful person to everyone I meet, I have probably met about 5 genuine kind people my entire life. Everyone seems so superficial and fake. I try to be a good person but life keeps kicking me down.

Around February 2020 I knew that if I didn't change my life I would kill myself sooner rather than later. So I got my license and started going to the gym, and finally found some hobbies that look interesting such as cooking, rock climbing at the gym, and volunteering at an animal shelter.

Then the stupid Chinese government became responsible for a worldwide pandemic and here in the U.S our government has been handling it like a brain dead sack of potatoes left to rot in a dumpster. Just like that I couldn't go the gym, couldn't go to college to meet friends, couldn't go rock climbing, couldn't volunteer at an animal shelter, couldn't apply for a job. that's it fucking nothing. 

Of course recently lockdowns have been reducing, I can go the gym at least but still can't rock climb, can't volunteer either, can't go to college online classes fucking blow, can't date anyone since meeting people irl is a no go and please don't suggest superficial fake af online dating. Although surprisingly after like 2 days of job searching I am already hired at a cool fun place that looks like it has some chill coworkers to make friends with.

But for me, this still isn't fast enough. I want everything open so I can have a normal life and actually be happy for once in 5 years. Ik it's selfish to want everything to open and risk millions of deaths. But you know what else is selfish? forcing millions to stay at home without paying bills, increased loneliness and mental illness, increased domestic abuse, increased divorce rates, increased suicide rates etc etc.

I want to be a therapist since ik exactly what it feels like to be in the most miserable state possible, to feel like nothing will ever be okay and that you could never be happy. I beat my depression all by myself but Ik not everyone can, so the if I can help others struggling with that, I could find peace.

I keep hearing people say it isn't about you, it's about our contributed effort for everyone, for society and others etc etc. But let me ask this, why the fuck should I care about others when almost everyone I have interacted with life has been horrible? Why should I give a shit about the people who made my life miserable? who never helped me or cared? 

I know obviously not every person is bad but what else am I supposed to think and feel when this has been my experience. The way others have treated me in my life has left me jaded and wary of others who may not deserve it. All of a sudden I'm supposed to help and stop my own happiness and progress just so other people can be healthy? The same people who treated me life shit my whole life? Sorry but I couldn't care less. 

I know this is pretty unhealthy but seriously I can't in any way mentally accept all of this for ""the betterment of everyone"".",0
96,sad,"I don't have a single happy memory from when i was younger apart from a ""clip"" of me playing in the snow when i was 4 years old. every memory after that up until i was 8 years old is just filled with abuse and violence from my mother.

Things didn't improve much when i lived with my father, he frequently left me to fend for myself so he could either sell drugs or have sex with women. I practically raised myself until i was 11. At this point my mother coaxed me into returning to her and my little half-sister, under the guise that she had changed and was no longer an abusive person. Obviously that was a lie, and within 2 weeks of being back the abuse started. I was cooking and cleaning, getting my little sister ready for primary school. Hell the only thing she did was sleep on the couch. I had my friends around a lot and in the end she accused them of molesting my little sister. I still believe to this day that she did that because she wanted to sleep from 4pm-6pm and the noise we made stopped that from happening.

Eventually my aunt got involved and told me to live with her and i did. Although once i lived with her it was great, holidays every year and just a nice household. About 2 years in my mother threw accusations that i tried to kill my sister and that i molested her. My entire family got involved and it turned out that my sisters father was a convicted pedophile and put a knife to my mothers throat back in the day. So it transcribed that she was just throwing the same experiences about to effectively bend the truth to whatever situation she could. My entire family black-sheeped her and she was literally forgotten about.

Now although no one believed her, my mental health has just been destroyed, my confidence with dealing with children has really messed up to the point where i feel like can't interact with them because in the back of my mind i think people think i'm a pedophile when i'm most definitely not. This has caused a rift between my godson and my little 2nd cousins which i regard as my nephews. Although i want to be stupid, silly and all loving but this mental wall is just stopping me from doing this. In fact, i find it very difficult to love anyone, it's like i lack the functionality feel that emotion at all.

My sister has tried to contact me on multiple occasions but since she still regularly speaks to my mother, even though shes been sectioned on more than one occasion, i don't trust her or what she has been manipulated to believe by my mother. My family have expressed concerns about her intentions and strongly believe i should not interact with her at all, although one day if i have children i would love her to be an auntie to them, so long as my mother is kept far away and even in the dark.

I think I've rambled on a lot and need to ask the question, can you ever mentally heal from a complete lack of love? has this forever messed me up and i'm never going to be happy or even be able to fully love another human being? People will say get help, but then i'll need a therapist and opening up about this to other people, in real life is scary. Another aspect its almost like i'm like my mother if i have server mental health issues and i never want to be like her. Also I've never opened up to my family about how i feel every single day and i don't want them to judge me, and think i'm a freak, like my mother.",-2
97,sad,"I don�t feel well. That's an understatement. I feel like shit. I do the same thing everyday. Wake up, shower, go to work, workout, come back home and eat dinner, get high and go to sleep. I recently found out that I won�t be able to go to back to school for this next semester, so I won�t be able to go back and see some of the best friends I have ever made for at least six months. Because of this, I have nothing to look forward to, and I have too much time to question what I am doing with myself. Everything feels pointless and I don�t feel like trying. It seems pretty hopeless. I �shouldn�t� feel this way. I have a decent amount of friends here, no money issues or any major source of outside stress, and I�m in very good physical shape. To many people at work, I may seem like one of the happiest people. But I can�t avoid the feeling of emptiness when I come home every single day. I�ve always struggled with mental health issues, but I've never seen anyone to get help, and I rarely talk to my friends about it because I always convince myself that somehow, someway, I�ll eventually be �fine�. It just feels different this time. I almost cry myself to sleep every night, just thinking about what a waste I am. I�m not really anything special to anyone or even myself. What can I do?",-2
98,sad,"I don't know if this is the right place, but atm I have no where else to go. I'm a 25(M), life has been strange for a while. I've been home for 2 years now, in a suburb Long Island neighborhood. Every so often I go through cycles of some kind. Basically right now, and for the past week it's like everything has vanished. I'm floating in the void inside my own head, and as I sit here I can't find the words to explain everything. I'm currently between therapists, I was receiving free therapy from my school that I just graduated from, so I have no one to go to and I can't find anyone to dump this on. The COVID situation is making my job market nonexistent. I'm applying for teacher positions, but everyday I feel like I'm going to have to wait another year and work the job I can't stand, service. That might not sound like a big deal, but I have epilepsy and i take daily medication. In a year (Feb 2021) I am taken off my parents medical insurance, so i NEED a job with medical. Since moving home my social life has taken a nose dive with all my friends moving on with their lives. I had to go back to school for a certification which was a two years program so i threw myself at it with full force (bad undergrad GPA put me immediately on academic probation) and i never bothered making new friends or trying to find a relationship, which is another can of worms. Right before COVID began I was telling myself that this year I was going to change things. I wanted to change, find new people, a partner, a new life I could make my own. The teacher job market looked promising, my grades were stellar, I had lost a great amount of weight and was feeling amazing. Now everything feels like its fallen apart. I can't stand another year at home, I feel stuck here and unable to change. I cant justify moving because I only have like $25,000 saved up and it just doesn't feel like enough to try and start a life with. Even as I write this I feel like I'm complaining about nothing, everyone as issues, I'm no different. I'm struggling to even post this because other people could use the attention and I can just figure this out myself. But when I look in the mirror I just see disappointment. I feel lost and scared and angry and hope feels like its slipping away every day. I just want to break everything and lay in the wreckage, but I know that isn't the way. I dont want pity and at the same time I just want someone to sit down with and tell me it's okay and the fear and anxiety and self loathing is only temporary. I want direction, but at the same time I want to find the path myself. I want to hit something and defend myself, but I also just want to world to cave in and end this horrible feeling I feel in my head and chest. I feel like I've hit a dead end and I can scale the wall to freedom or accept it's over. But it's not over, my life has only begun.

99,sad,"Hi, im 19f. I�m not having hallucinations (as far as I�m concerned, however the doctor in charge of my mental health care is aware and is monitoring the situation). I don�t think they�re hallucinations as much as delusions and paranoia. Reflections will move and change slightly, become warped etc. I�ll see things very vividly in my peripheral vision. I get really strong feelings of uneasiness, being watched, having something near me, of creatures waiting for me around corners and chasing me through the house and trying to get at me when I close my eyes. When things are bad, I�ll think there�s a little girl standing next to my bed and I�ll talk to her. She doesn�t talk back and I can�t see her, I just really really believe that she�s there. At the moment, I can�t be in my bedroom at night. I stay downstairs on the sofa with my dog, maybe get a couple hours sleep, then go upstairs at about 5am when it starts getting light and be able to sleep a few more hours. I tried to go to bed at midnight tonight, I lasted a whole 2 minutes in my room before having a panic attack and having to leave. What�s going on. Like I said, my doctor is aware of what�s going on because I tried to be honest last time he called me, but I�ve been hiding the true extent of it from everyone, including him, because I don�t want them to think I�m losing it.

104,sad,"Sorry this is going to be pretty negative so maybe don't read if you're struggling right now. 

I just wanted to have a quick rant about the thoughts I've been having lately.

I've been having a really rough week, like really rough. And basically I feel so damm lonely! I'm lonely yet I have a family and a friend, and a boyfriend.

My boyfriend is really understanding and he's been great. I lived with him last year and it was lovely and when I had a bad time there he'd always be so good at helping me lift out of it. Yet now I'm at home and because of covid I don't see him often at all. And it's been like a punch in the stomach.

A punch in the stomach at the realisation that my family are there for me but they don't understand my pain. My boyfriend does to an extent but I can't keep calling him so upset and then ruining his mood and his day and not to mention that he now feels he can't share his hurt with me.

Even when I speak to people there's nothing they can do is there. Let's be real, this is all in my own head and I don't know why it's took so long to realise but omg I have to deal with this all by myself. Noone else can make the anxiety go away, no matter how many nice things they say or how calm they try and make me.

Noone can put my life back together for me and it sucks. It sucks that I'm battling this horrible illness, or these illnesses and appart from the times of happiness with others, when I'm in pain then it's all down to me.

This makes me so angry at my mind, at my life and at everything in general to be honest. It's not fair. I didn't do anything wrong.

107,sad,"Just mentioning beforehand that I have thoughts of suicide, just saw a bridge on the way home and was thinking about something random like how big the sign was so close up (I was in a car) and then my mind just immediately switched to wanting to jump. But I have no plans of killing myself as of right now, I just need some words of encouragement so that I don't go any lower. 

To start off, I have anxiety and depression and have been diagnosed for about 4 months. I started taking Abilify about a month ago, and the first week of 2 mg I felt great, and then it stopped working after a week. The doctor increased to 5 mg, which worked great again but now I can feel the same thing happening and just not working anymore. 

I am currently a pharmacy student and on rotations for 3 weeks. For those who don't know, basically we go to a pharmacy in different settings, hospital for me, and just shadow, learn the job, stuff like that. I'm about halfway into it and I just don't want to do it anymore. This, school, just everything. I made so many mistakes that are probably no big deal but anxiety makes it so much worse. Pharmacists are the last check before a medication goes out to a patient. With anxiety, I doubt my decisions every time and just paranoid that I did something wrong. I don't know what I want to do when I graduate and I have a really bad knee and ankle from a sprain few years ago so I don't know how long my body will hold out in retail (that's where I work at now). 

I don't have my psychiatrist appointment until next week, my counseling appointment isn't until Friday (and he's pretty bad about checking and responding to emails so I don't want to bother him) and I don't want to bother my friend with my problems. I thought about suicide hotline but honestly I didn't find it very personable. I need some support to get the courage to get through...this thought? Day? rest of the week?

I spoke with another person on this subject and they were the one who is making me decide that I need to do this.

Then other times, I just feel extremely uneasy and start yawning and shaking. At that point, all I can think about is either death or I can try to redirect my mind to something else, but it never fully goes away because at that state I'm relating everything towards that.

i've always been a very closed off person when it comes to how i'm feeling and the things that are hard for me to deal with. i usually wait for the hard time to pass and then discuss it in therapy. i know it's not the most effective way to treat it but it's just the best way i can.

Recently I've developed massive **anxiety** because of it; I overthink simple social gatherings with friends I've known for a long time, I am absolutely petrified of going on dates with girls and struggle with things that could possibly get me further in life.

\- I can't **concentrate** on things for a long time unless it's Netflix, Youtube, Instagram etc. I try to limit how much time I spend on these platforms as It's in the consciousness of society now that consuming too much of these things is obviously bad for you. But I used to be so ambitious and determined to put in the work that would make my life better but I find myself just wasting time and procrastinating on things so much.

\- My **discipline** has dwindled. This may link in to the previous paragraph but I've noticed I just have no discipline anymore. I never go to bed on time as my free time is very limited but it bites me in the ass the next day as I'm exhausted and work 12 hour days at work. I never sit down and do anything productive anymore as I find it mind-numbingly boring.

\- I've recently feel like I have had an **existential crisis.** My 27th birthday is 3 weeks away and I'm petrified of it as I work a mediocre job that is going no where even though I have so many things I want to do and accomplish in my life but I feel I am held back by the above. I don't know what my purpose is anymore. I used to want to be rich and constantly thought about it all the time but now I feel like it's an impossible thing to achieve with such a low rate of success and, again, the above holds me back somewhat.

\- This may not be relevant or could be extremely relevant but I also **drink and take drugs**. I feel it's necessary to mention this for obvious reasons. I would say I drink every week, some nights it's literally a beer after work at home, sometimes I do go out with friends and I end up drinking a lot and taking cocaine with my friends, not a huge amount (half a gram max) and I do it maybe once every 2 weeks - a month. I find coke makes me depressed the next day (common) as well. I know it's easy to say ""say no"" or ""you're hanging out with the wrong people"" but I've reluctantly been taking it semi-regularly for around 5 years now and when you're drunk it is so hard to say no, it's like my body sniffs the line for me without me being able to control it and after wards I'm left to think about the ""decision"" I've made, furthermore due to my stutter I don't feel like i can go out and just make new friends easily. I mentioned this in case anyone else has had a similar experience with long term drug use and can offer advice on this.

113,sad,"I have grown up as the only child in a toxic household. My dad is an alcoholic, and my mother didn't really do anything about it, and generally just disregarded the seriousness of the issue. But overall is a good mother.

My dad drank every night, more or less, with 3/4 nights going out to drink. From the ages of 11-16 I would stay up late to make sure when he came home there was no arguing. My school work suffered, I never had enough sleep, and this is where my anxiety stems from.There were nights where my parents would argue, he was never physically abuse but has broken items in the house. Definitley emotionally abusive. I don't know if I am ready to write about specific events. 

By the age of 14 I could not eat the days I knew he was going out, I would throw up if I heard them raise their voices, and I strarted self harming. I have had this anxiety feeling since, I went to the doctors around this time and was told ""it would pass"". I felt sick every single morning, physically sick say 30% of mornings. School didn't take it seriously even though I went to the doctors a lot. My mother only half took it seriously. I had to have my own room for my GCSE exams, my invigilator opened a can on coke and the sound it made just made me panic, mid exam. 

My dad bought his own house around the time I was 16 and started to stay there if he went out, which wasn't as often as before. Whilst I would still worry, I knew I don't have to stay up to make sure he comes in and doesn't argue. This was also the age I began drinking with friends, and had fun for the most part.

I moved out at 19 for university and loved having my own safe space, and enjoyed drinking at the start. I started taking antidepressants before my second year of university. I now have a month left at my student house before I have to move back with my parents, and have finished university.

For the past year I have found I can't handle alcohol, I will drink some, but I can't enjoy myself like I used to, and I feel this has been a long time coming. I have drunk less and less on nights out and try to leave early, or if I can not go out at all. 

I have been worried about my parents since the beginning of lockdown, if my dad would drink, would they argue? Would I be able to go and resolve it? Would I finally resort to calling the police? What would the aftermath of that be like? 

And now last night my housemate had two friends down, so them three and me and my boyfriend joined in. They played drinking games and I drank when I found it physically hard to. I was worried about being a miserable person in general and ruining the fun but I really did try. It got too much in the end and they were shouting and creating a lot of banging. One banged on the door as I was in the toilet and it just brought back memories and I broke down. I just don't want to see alcohol anymore. 

I don't know what I want from this post, but maybe similar experiences and outcomes. Any help I can get? I don't know I just want responses I guess.",-2
114,sad,"

A while ago, my doctor suggested I may have agoraphobia and he put me on zoloft. The first few weeks were great, it felt like I was finally getting better. It didn't work as well for a little bit after that, and so I asked for my mom to call in and up the dosage. It helped a little, and it eventually stopped doing anything. My doctor said I should go to therapy but it never happened. 

A few months after that initial doctor's appointment, me and my mom were fighting and she ended up calling me crazy because she 'needed to take me to the doctors for being too nervous'. And after that, I just stopped trying to reach out for help. I always think about it. And maybe she didn't mean it, maybe she said it in the heat of the moment, but it hurt me a lot. It made me feel horrible, especially with all I went through to try and get help in the first place.

My anxiety has been getting worse, I can't talk to people I'm not close to without feeling like the wind is getting knocked out of me. My presentation anxiety used to be bad, but it's gotten even worse. I can't speak in front of a group without nearly crying or having a whole panic attack. And even when it's not in front of a group, when I talk about my feelings aloud, even for a small portion of the conversation, I'll just burst out into tears and I have no idea what the hell is going on. I could feel fine in the moment but appear to be 'In a mood' and if one of my parents asks if I'm okay, I just feel like I'm going to start sobbing in front of them.

I've been having trouble taking my medicine anymore, and I've been self harming. Usually it's only a couple of times every few weeks when everything bubbles over and I want to hurt myself, but it gets even worse on my period. I'll stay in bed and hardly take care of myself and I'll just lay here and feel horrible and think about what it would be like if I could off myself. I've never made plans, but whenever I get too stressed out, I always find myself looking up painless ways to go, just incase I can't take it anymore.

It feels like everything is just a mess, and I don't know what to do. My sister used to have extreme mental health problems, but she never told our parents, and I feel like if I try to keep getting help, it'd just be really unfair. She deserved help too but she didn't get it when she needed it most and that makes me feel so fucking horrible.

I don't know what else to say honestly. If you're reading this, thank you. and I hope you have a nice rest of your day",-3

117,sad,"Hi everyone!

I'm over 25, suffering from agoraphobia and, things leading to another, living with my parents with no job. I'm not making much progress because I fear pain and basically have no motivation to do anything causing me pain. Finding love recently has pushed me to see a hypnotherapist and I've made baby improvements, but I unfortunately have bad reflexes of sadness, self-loathing and basically doing nothing when I'm feeling bad.

However, my parents are worried and upset and recently decided to enforce rules for me for my own good (like waking up at a certain time, doing chores, etc.)

Unfortunately, this resulted in me feeling really disappointed and angry at them. I said that I expected them to be kind and helpful instead of punishing, but they simply answered that being kind did nothing and that they're not punishing but helping. According to online ressources, taking your child's things away and giving them consequences when they act in a way you disapprove is legit education, but as someone in a child position, I find it hard to swallow, haha. I am of course aware that it is their home and that I have to submit, but I feel that trust has been broken between us.

This has at least motivated me to try and find a job (so that I can leave lol), and some of my friends are ready to motivate and help me in a positive way. I will start CBT very soon to see if the therapist can help me get any motivation.

Does anyone have tips to motivate me to work on my phobia and on my life in general? Is there an alternative I can suggest to my parents instead of them ""helping"" with childish rules? (Or am I an entitled brat for imagining my parents owe me anything?)",-1

It's very hard to stay positive and not get sad when you *know* upsetting thing's are happening, and when you wish you were in someone else's place. But regardless I'm gonna try because this is important to me and I want to achieve my goal, I want my happily ever after. Thing's are always going to be more challenging for me because of how I am, so I need to work a lot harder than others, that's the way it's always been.

121,sad,"I quit my first �proper� job last year at an advertising agency because I can�t survive the stress, rushing project all the time, standing by on weekend eventho is my birthday, dreading my body to work each day like a zombie with a few hours of sleep. Constantly getting idea rejected by client, fuck idk how many changes for one campaign. While I learned my lesson that I shouldn�t quit without a backup job. At that time I was just dying to get out there because I was so so so depressed everyday I wish I could just drop dead and not need to face my creative director and all the stupid client.

Right after I quit my grandma got sick and I�m taking care of her everyday in the hospital back to back. Then she left us.

Then I was doing freelance work while looking for a job right before the pandemic hit, even looking for internships/ part time job. Anything but no luck at all. I went to several interviews and sent a lot of emails. 

When the pandemic hit, my freelance project went poof, I�ve got no any client at all. I�ve try to register on platform like fiverr ,workana, etc but I didn�t get any reply. Now that things are slowly shifting back to �normal� where businesses slowly open up again in my country I was hopeful, yet I still got no reply no matter how many job I applied. I just need a temporary job until I can pursue my degree this September as a mature student. 

I feel like I�m doing nothing. Like I�m waiting for time to pass. I feel guilty that my boyfriend is covering up our rent and my dad still occasionally send me money because he knew I�m not surviving. I can�t even get a job like as a waitress. 

I feel like I should be like getting my shit together at this age (25F). Sorry for the vent. I just feel awful and wanted to let it out. I will do my best to keep looking for job.

125,sad,"I self harmed for the first time since November, and this is the worst I have in a few years. I just need to vent everything out and if you read this thank you. If you respond double thank you.

I�ve had a poor sense of self image for most of my life (history of self harm, body dysmorphia, and eating disorders). Over the past year, self esteem has been an extreme stressor because my boyfriend is dramatically skinnier than me. I love him more than anything but sometimes just looking at a picture of us next to each other sparks negative self talk. Anyways, this is just one factor that has been contributing to a perpetually low self esteem, which affects my overall mental health.

I always thought that body modifications would make me view myself better because even if I didn�t see myself as beautiful, I could at least cover myself in beautiful things. I�ve been saving up for a tattoo and finally got it today and the artist completely messed up a major part of it. I hate looking at it and am completely embarassed by it. My boyfriend and roommate disagree and don�t think it�s that bad/easily fixable. While I think that I can eventually get it covered up, right now all I can think about is how there�s just one more part of myself that I hate and can�t stand to look at. I felt out of control and turned to self harm.

Typing it out makes me feel like I was being dramatic about it but I really can�t stand the fact that I thought that I was making a decision that would make me happy and help me love myself, but now I feel even worse and all I want to do is tear it out of me",-3

I don't have many friends, either. I have a friend that is never home, one that never talks/hangs out with me, and two online friends, but we rarely talk. People constantly make fun of me. 

I just want everything to end. I don't know what to do anymore. I want to keep going for my best friend (the one that is never home), but it doesn't seem worth it. 

She's told me that if I killed myself, she'd kill herself. I don't want her to die, I want her to be happy.

128,sad,"Wow! It turned out to be a long and lengthy rant! Please go through it and tell me how you interpret it. So please go through it, it will be highly appreciated and don't get deterred by the length. Thanks.

I had this account created some 6 months back but it stayed there, just like that. Idk what drove me to reddit these past few days, 6 days to be precise. Came across this sub the very first day and it intrigued me. Never thought that it's a possibility. I faced the horns of dilemma these past few days, drowning in memes and ghost stories, but this sub remained, never ready to say what I should have long ago. But now, I am here, at last.

What are abusive parents actually? I had gone through many a incidents of users facing abuse at the hands of their parents which I never thought possible for a parent. Those are only there for the movies, I thought. A broken child, growing up to be a person of its own. A true surviving story. But here I found many survivors. Am I one? After all movies are based on real lives.

Where do I begin! As far as my memory goes, my parents were very good and loving to me but I was mainly brought up by my grandma. There isn't much that I remember from that period. But I faintly remember an incident, I think it is from my 1st grade. It was the day of the parents teachers meeting along with the distribution of the report cards. I remember father had taken me to school and the teacher had spoken in lengths with him. He looked sombre once we left school school, not saying a word on the return journey but I was okay (didn't understand what results meant as such I guess). On return, I saw my father and mom getting together and speaking in hushed tones that somehow made me afraid, may be the vibes they were giving out. So remember running to my grandma. She stayed with us till her death. But going there later. So, I run into her arms afraid, almost at the verge of tears and ask her, what was wrong? She wouldn't say anything but smiled and gave me candies instead and told me while I was having them, now the thing removed from mind, that my report card was colourful! I didn't get it that time but was happy that it might be something good then. But soon, hell broke lose, as my father marched into her room and grabbing me by my arm, dragged me to my parent's room and locked the door! He then took off his belt and started hitting me with it. I don't remember the pain anymore, just remember grandma's face through the window, crying and asking him to stop. I have no memory of it from there and never asked anybody about it. Apparently I had failed my 1st grade, so my report card was marked with red.

I don't know what changed, but I became a good student from then on. Good in class and at home. Results improved, I mean I was getting almost full marks in every subject till I was in the 4th grade. Now coming to my parents, they were good all along this period! Remember occasional thrashing for my antiques, but it never bothered me that much. My father took interest in my studies and would task and test me from time to time. I never gave room for complaints.

But a thing that stood out, all through my school life, even in high school, was that it was my grandma who prepared my breakfast, my tiffin, getting me ready and everything while my parents slept. I had early morning school, starting from 7.15 in the morning. Till fourth grade my father used to drop me but then I used to take my bike and go. So when I left, it was just my grandma who would see me off. It still stayed with me and it doesn't sit well with me, idk why!

Growing up, I soon started going out on my own to the playground, parks to play with my friends after school, or be it basketball practice at school but everybody knew about the rule I had! My father returned from work (he was an engineer working for the government) at around 6-6.30 in the evening and I can't be out after that. So each day no matter where I was, I had to return home by 6. On the occasions (there were a few, growing in number as older I got) I wasn't home, I was not allowed in on return and has to wait outside the closed doors for sometimes hours (2 and half hour being the longest if I remember correctly) till someone, mostly my grandma forced my father to open the door.

Then I had the study routine, I had to sit down to study by 7 or else a round of either shouting or a few slaps here and there. And God save me if I dozed off studying! But nothing was a surprise as a cousin of mine used to get beaten up for getting 95 out of 100 cause someone got more than her ( her father is a gem, but I even feared her mother).

Time goes on and I go from class to class, year to year, more of less the same thing. But the thrashing or shouting reduced drastically again due to my grandma, who made my father understand that now I am grown up and shouldn't be treated so. Somehow it struck a chord with my father.

My mother all along was somewhat non existent, she too feared my father but he wasn't abusive towards any other person. Never drank, had no bad habits, but still he was this raging fireball towards me. My mother on the other hand never stopped him but would emotionally manipulate me, into doing what they thought best for me. (Now I come to think of it as emotional manipulation, god this subreddit helped me a lot). 

Hitting puberty is a time when there's need for guidance and being the only child had no one. I was sent to a boy's only school, a missionary one. So never came across girls much and it was discouraged even at home (though not directly). So naturally it made me nervous around girls. At this time I came across a girl in an extra class taken at our teachers house. She was beautiful and almost immediately I fell for her. But had no guts even to talk to her and moreover she was Muslim (a big no no in our family). So controlled my urges and thinking about everything, never approached her, not even a hi was exchanged! (She is a good friend of my now and I told her everything but it was too late, as she got married, but that's for another account! I even wrote a letter in blood, stupid teenager, huh!)

I did well in my 10th standard and decided to go ahead with science (my father wanted me to be an engineer, just like him!) and went ahead with it. But somehow I didn't find it interesting. I failed in a couple of subjects in the first term, but soon I put all my efforts in and recovered. But in my senior year I meet this girl and things changed!

I now had started growing a mind of my own (I know it was high time) so when I met this girl (from the neighborhood) I again fell head over heels for her but this time the only difference was, I approached her. Soon we became good friends, chatting over the new phone I got. She was a Muslim too, but this time something had changed in me and I dared. Friendship grew into something special but before it could go ahead anymore, somehow my father came to know about her! (I didn't tell my parents, or even my friends as I didn't want to end it prematurely. I wasn't prepared tbh) Anyways my father engaged me in a conversation about her. I played safe by neither accepting or denying, leaving it open to interpretation. That mad him even more mad but this time I got no thrashing but for a few days my existence was ignored! I was cool with that but what followed, I wasn't prepared for it.

I still remember quite vividly! It was a Sunday evening, winter had just set in and the air had lost its moisture but became chilly. I and my GF, were strolling around a park away from both our places ( she too hadn't told about me), when suddenly out of the blue, a car started honking just behind us. I turned to curse but only to find our car and father driving it. I was forced to get in, leaving her alone ( I won't forget that day, the look on her face, the last look I got of her) to get back home. 
I was taken back immediately and grinding began, this time both my parents! They accused her of being Muslim (as if it mattered) then going on to call her names, till being called a prostitute. I broke down at first then burst out, tearing my shirt as the buttons went flying in every direction, but at that moment a hard and tight slap rang across my face! It was my father, who hit me again after 4-5years! I couldn't take it anymore and left home. I went to the park but she was gone. Her phone has been switched off when I tried calling her. I got tensed!

For the night I went to my best friend's place and told him everything, about her to the events of that day. I asked him not tell my parents if they asked (they surely will visit, I knew). Nothing happened that day or the next. I had skipped school and contemplated my next moves. I tried calling her but again her phone was off! It frustrated me the whole day. I even thought of returning home and go to her place to sort out but I controlled that urge.

With nightfall came my father (my friend's parents had forced him into a betrayal, kid you not, it did feel like it then) and with him the news that my parents had visited my now ex-GF's house to talk her parents out of it so that their daughter doesn't meet me! Now I knew what the switched off phone meant! They knew I wouldn't budge, so they took the matter into their own hands. And everything was lost for me. 

My studies suffered, my mental health too took a toll (all this I am understanding now, at that time I was made to believe that these were side effects of puberty). I wasn't left alone, father started accompanying me to school and mother on the return. I somehow grew distant with my parents this time. 

Soon school life was over and I took tests to get into an Engineering College. (I wasn't sure then, but my parents wanted the legacy to go on). All these years my grandma was always there to support me, my only lifeline that kept me sane.

Now I got the opportunity to go away. It was back in 2006. I left my parents place and took an apartment in the city where my college was, some 150 miles from my parent's place. It was kind of a relief, I'll not lie! I started studying and enjoying my college life. Met, a girl in the 2nd year and everything was going well. But she opened me to art and performance art! I was always a movie buff but now I knew what I wanted to be and it wasn't an engineer! I would talk to my father on a daily basis almost ( understand, I didn't know anything how felt then) but somehow my father started changing. His change started soon after the GF fiasco. But still he was my father.

Now when everything is great my mother wanted to drop in and stay with me for a few months (apparently she missed me but I only missed my grandma, who blessed me when I left) and so she did but soon events take a turn for the sour as I was no longer the kid that left my home town, but somewhat of an independent thinker. Soon we started to clash and it was my turn to burst out but each time I did, she would break into tears, feigning a stroke (sometimes when things went out of hand) and we both lost mental peace. It went on like this for over an year ( she must have thought with time I would again change, but this time they were in for a surprise) but I didn't budge (I had broken up with this girl friend again because mom didn't like her and I don't know how it crept in to our relation, driving us apart) it was her this time she had to leave. And she left and never asked to return, thank god! 

By now I had stopped going to college and started studying about films and filmmaking on my own. And one day out of the blue I dropped out of engineering, pursue a career in film making. Surprisingly my father didn't say much but left it to me to decide, just stating the pros and cons. But for my mother now all hell broke loose. She tried every trick in her bag to get me back to engineering but this time I didn't budge. I sought out filmmakers and started assisting them, first as intern then gradually moving up the ranks. It was in 2010.

My father now seems more approachable than my mother, as she continues to discourage, even till today, using her emotional tactics. Father now gets pissed at her for this attitude but she still does. I would visit them on a bi-monthly visit, mainly to see my grandma, who was happy for me.

In 2017 my grandma died and every attachment I had to the place died with her. Never gone back since and never saw my mother too. But we sometimes talk on the phone. I meet my father every month and he is a totally different person now. But my mother still keeps nagging, the new one being, to get married! Which I will not in the near future.

I will be 33 this July 16th and now have a stable girlfriend of 7 years+, have a few movies behind me, mainly writing and assisting. My own documentaries, ads, short films and an IMDB page with 15 credits to my name.

Idk if I was raised by abusers, still now not able to judge them, so those who went through my lengthy piece be the judge and tell me. What happened to me?",-1

I started to get severe anxiety (diagnosed with situational anxiety) so yesterday (Tuesday) I asked her what was wrong and.......... and the issues boil down to that she cares about me...... that I embody everything that she could ever want in a SO....... but she can�t imagine me with her when she imagines the future.......

And........ truly........ I have been in so many relationships where the person says that they don�t love me....... but they just......... want to stay in that relationship?..... I.....

And I guess I just......... don�t know how to process my sadness... she just................ 

It feels that the world wants to make sure I knows i do not deserve to be loved in any way shape of form... when I�m a temp, when I�m a forced date, when I�m a crutch, when I�m a rebound, when I�m a literal joke, when I�m a expected fixture, and.... and when I even have the chance of being actually loved and cared for.... and I�m....

Whatever I am...... it�s not worth of anyone.... no matter the circumstances...... and my fear of living and dying alone is something I just need to accept....... I�m........ I�m not worthy of love and that�s okay....

And I�m ready to accept that.",-3
130,sad,"It�s so cool that after 2 years of hard work in therapy and working on myself, I�ve been able to develop the tools I need to navigate everyday life. I don�t have anxiety anymore, I�m typically not depressed, and I�m doing such a good job navigating life. However, certain events in life set me off and I�m forced to face the reality that I do have a mental illness. 

Example: I got into an argument with my brother last weekend when I was visiting my parents. I erupted into a severe panic attack, my first one in ages, and I fell into a deep depression for days, and had an alcohol relapse. My parents had to come to my house and drag me out of bed. I was hysterical. I hadn�t cleaned my house in days. I hadn�t slept. Work was unbearable. I couldn�t focus on basic tasks. 

I�m so proud of all of the progress I�ve made and that I�ve learned to navigate every day life and get out of bed in the morning, which is something I struggled with for such a long time. I�ve come such a long way and that�s great, but it�s so scary when one seemingly minor event reminds me that I do have anxiety and depression. What hurts is that I manage it so well that I forget I have it. That�s what makes the episodes of strong uncontrollable emotion so hurtful to me. I never see it coming because I forget that part of me exists. 

Then, I inevitably have to spend a week or two focusing extra hard on mindfulness, exercise, checking in with my therapist, and managing my diet to make sure that I can recover properly. Because once I�m down, getting back up is work. I have intense flashbacks of whatever caused me stress, I don�t sleep well, and I can�t stop replaying the events in my head. 

Coming back is nice, but at the same time I hate the glaring reminder that navigating life is a bit tougher for me. I wish that weren�t the case. My family is always very concerned for me and I never understand why. But, the more i see my pattern develop, I understand why they worry. It�s because no matter how long I keep it together, they inevitably have to come scrape me off the floor at least twice a year. It sucks that I put that burden on my parents.",-2
131,sad,"

When I was a child, my mother try to teach me four languages. It was a good choice she made. We had to move many times. Speaking four language help me a lot. I can speak four languages but not all fluent. I have a hard time to remember words and grammar. It is even for my native language. Sometimes I say the right word then mess up. It is hard for me to always remember. I can read English very well. I can not write or speak English well. This is a problem sometimes when I speak of my mental health.

It has been very hard talking about mental health. Many people do not understand what I am try to say. It means I have to repeat myself many times. I try to write my mental health but people do not understand that too. It is very hard to talk. My best friend understand what I am saying a lot. But she does not understand all of the time.

If I speak in my native language it is hard too. Many words are lost in my mind. It is hard to speak it sometimes. There are many words in English that I do not know in Cambodian, Chinese, or Jarai. There are some words I do not know in English. People say to use Google to translate but the translates do not always make it right. Sometimes the words are not equal or make sense. My mental health is worse by the languages. I would want to forget one language to be better in another. 

When I am sad I hurt myself. I do not think I do it in the bad way. When I hurt myself I pinch my arm. Sometimes my arm gets a bruise or it gets blooded. I do not do this all of the time. I only do this if I am very sad. A lot of the time I cry and sleep. I sleep many days for a long time.

I live in a small town. People are mean to me for many reasons. I do not look like the people in the town. My voice is different. It is hard for me to speak. My brain is different. I do not understand what a lot of people do. I do not feel romance or sex the same way. People think I am a freak for being a boy who is not wanting sex. People say mean things about me because I have not kissed a girl. I do not need to kiss a girl for people to be nice to me. 

It was very hard moving to America. I did not get to say goodbye to my friends. Many people of my family do not live here. I do not think I will ever see my friends or my family again. That make me sad. I think about them a lot. To think about them makes me cry. I cry every night for them. When I google it said I have depression. That feels okay for me. It said many other things too. Anxiety. Post traumatic stress disorder. It said I may have the ADHD and OCD. I do not know if I have any of it. It said to talk to a doctor about them. I do not think I can go to the doctor. My mom does not have extra money. She provide all things for us now. 

It is difficult to know many people will not understand me. It is sad that many people will not learn or help me learn that way we can be friends. I want good friends in my life. I love the friends I have but they do not always understand. They support me always. But they do not know my hard life. Many thing happened that I do not like to talk about. It hurts me too much to speak. I want to get help but I do not think I can. That is okay. I will still live. My mom would be very sad if I did die. I can not make her sad. I will live for her and the many nice people I know. I will live for my neighbor that I like very much. Not in a romance way. I like her as a friend I think. She is very kind. I like kind people.

133,sad,"In high school, I had this bully. I'm not trans, but I do have a ""deadname""-my given name which I hate, do not use, and get very uncomfortable if someone calls me by. I go by a different name. This bully's given name was the same as my preferred name. The first day of class, the teacher was reading out our names from the sheet to take attendance, and he said my given name. I politely asked him not to call me by that, and to avoid confusion with the bully, to call us by our last names or number us. He ignored my request, and said that he would just call me by my given name as it was written on the sheet. After this interaction, for reasons I do not understand, this bully would shout my given name from across the room, with no provocation, at any time when the teacher wasn't directly talking to the class. Every day. Of every week. Over. And over. And over. Again. I couldn't tell the teacher to make him stop, since his apathy was the inciting event. I was afraid to tell anyone else (counselors, parents, etc) about it, because I was afraid they would think I was overreacting. For the first few weeks, I would tell the bully to stop each time he did it. When he didn't, for the next 2 months, I tried ignoring him, just like I had been told from childhood-ignore the bully, and they will stop. He did not stop. And, for these two months, each time he did it, I could feel it striking like a chisel on my skull. Each time, my hate for him only grew. Towards the end of the two months, I would often imagine him in pain, suffering, and death, all inflicted by me, and laugh out loud at the mere thought. I truly didn't know how I could endure this for the 3 months left of the school year, and I didn't know what I would do when it became too much to bear. Fortunately, this all happened January through March of this year, and quarantine permanently separated us, so I never had to see hus face nor hear his voice again. But I still hate him. I still want to make him know what he has done to me. I still want to hurt him. I still picture myself killing him, and laugh. I still want to make him hurt. I thought these feelings would go away, but it's been months and they're as strong as ever. I know that I'll never see or hear from him again, but I still hate him. I know that I need help, but I don't know what to do. How do I let go of what he's done to me? To my mind? Should I let go at all? Help.",-3

Hey, this is my first post here and i�m quite nervous so i�m sorry if stuff i say doesn�t quite make sense, i�m a 17M and because of my past i�ve always had this feeling inside of me that i�m not good enough to be on this earth since i was around 7, i witnessed physical abuse and was on the end of it a few times, i have what i would consider bad ADHD and clinically diagnosed anxiety. In march 2020 i lost my grandmother to cancer and had to miss the funeral due to Covid-19, since then my mental health dropped, i couldn�t get out of bed most days for the best part of 2 months, during this time i attempted an OD twice, and have self-harmed several times, then i was getting better, then i lost my close friend to suicide, who i was speaking to the night before trying to stop him and he promised me he wouldn�t and still did, since then i�ve been on a downhill drop again, i�ve self harmed a lot again and considered suicide again, however this isn�t all, i recently came out as bisexual to my family and since then my stepfather has completely ignored me and refuses to speak to me, as well as this i went out with my friends, and they held me down and �beat the gay out of me�, i considered it a joke but the more i think about it the less i believe that, they also know about my struggles and recently told me to get over myself as i �don�t even have mental health issues and making it up to get attention and use it as an excuse so i don�t have to go out with them�, because of all of this i just feel so broken inside and i can�t seem to find a reason to stay alive anymore, i apologise for the long read.",-3
137,sad,"I think I�ve always struggled with mental health in the past, and I�ve just consistently kept too busy to give any second thought to it other than during occasional breakdowns that would involve me feeling more emotions than I�ve had in a while, crying, wondering if there is any meaning to life, etc. 

However, during this pandemic, I�ve had way too much free time, and I feel like I�ve lost a sense of purpose, just going through the motions. I feel like I�m so alone, but at the same time I�m scared to open up and trust others. There have also been really dark days where I think it�d be better if I not exist, but am too cowardly to actually follow through. I don�t know what I�m doing anymore.

138,sad,"I'm entering high school this year and I feel like I should be deciding my career already. I know some might think this is too early but it has been on my mind a lot lately. I've also been feeling pressure from family members who already had everything figured out at my age. I'm not very passionate about anything, to begin with, which is sad in itself. I feel like everyone has something that drives them in life, I'm kind of just living at the moment. Nothing excites me. I don't understand how people grow up dreaming about working, it doesn't sound like much fun. But, I know that I'll eventually need to get a job and I don't want to float from one minimum wage job to another my whole life. Planning out my future is scary and it feels as if everything will be locked in place once I do. I imagine myself going down the wrong path and regretting it my whole life. One part of me knows that these thoughts are coming prematurely and I should focus on the present but another part is screaming at me that time is wasting away and I've accomplished nothing. And by that, I mean literally nothing. I'm not creative or athletic, I don't play instruments, I'm not very smart or anything of that sort. I feel as if I'm blank.

139,sad,"So for the past 6 months i�ve been lashing out randomly for small things that go wrong, or if someone says/does something to irritate me, i go OFF. i�ve never had problems with anger or lashing out. shortly i turned 11, i was diagnosed with pretty bad depression, epilepsy, and a couple other health issues. i started feeling very depressed and emotions id never felt before. lonely, miserable, sad, , hopeless and thinking about death/suicide a lot. then i was put on medications to treat other health issues with side effects being depression even though i already had it. all my emotions felt amplified no matter what i was feeling. this was during summer before entering middle school. my parents were putting me in one where i knew nobody. school was the last thing on my mind. i was too depressed and miserable to care, thus leading to never make friends in middle school and failing classes. this continued all throughout middle school until i switched to online for most of high school. i attended freshman year but it was too much for me. i did however make 2 amazing friends and we�re still super close. so for years i was terribly depressed with no emotional outlet other than family who claimed i was just being dramatic and missed out on having friends, parties, going out, and normal stuff teens do. i was at home in bed either crying or playing video games to distract me from my issues. i�m 17 now and i haven�t been depressed for almost 2 years. it feels so good. i was in mental pain for so long i almost didn�t want to seek help. depression became my security blanket. leaving would mean i�d have to enter the real world and couldn�t just stay in my little toxic bubble. all this led to very low self esteem that i�ve been gradually rebuilding over years and getting better but lately i�ve suddenly been lashing out once or twice a month over everything. and now with this whole pandemic i�m trapped inside all day and im scared to return to where i used to be. i feel like i could explode with rage and break thing sometimes. is this anger from built up repression for years just now surfacing due to my depression and missing out on middle school and high school life? other than that ive been �normal�. what should i do? thanks for listening to me rant haha",-1

145,sad,"Hello everyone. These past few months have been hard on me and I felt like the world hates me. Every day I wanted to die and when I wake up, I feel disappointed because I'm still alive. But then I told myself that nothing will change if I'm not gonna step forward so I made a letter and sent it to the girl I love.

Ever since I was a child, I'm not good at opening up to other people, and yesterday I just steeled myself and open up to the girl I love. She said that I need to learn how to love myself before I can love others because if not, then there will be more problems coming into my life and she also said that I should not rush it and I need to change for myself and not for others (God I really love her).

After that, I had a deep reflection on myself. I always think that people secretly hate me and that I constantly feel that I'm just a burden for everybody. If a person doesn't reply to me I will tend to think that person dislikes me or I might have done something stupid that makes them hate me. I also think that people are talking to me because they are just being kind or they are bored and don't have someone to talk to. Even now I'm having a hard time trying to reconnect to my friends because I feel like I might just waste their time and I also think that they might not reply to me because I've taken a break from social media for almost 4 months. I can't stare at my face in the mirror or in a picture even for a short time since I feel like that I'm ugly, even if other people are saying that my face is decent. Also, sometimes when I am in a group of people and they are all having a casual conversation, I tend to be quiet since I'm afraid that they might not relate or ignore what I'm going to say.

After 4 years of not wanting to hurt myself anymore... I finally really want to start self harming again.
I want to feel the pain again so I can feel something.

I thought about cutting my thigh with my knife, but resorted to hitting my knee instead.
I'm so depressed and lonely... only 17. I have no one I can talk to.

My parents don't understand the full extent of my depression and Bipolar 2 disorder. They believe it's alright to leave an emotionally unstable depressed person by themselves and make it feel like it's their fault their depressed. 

I cant talk to my mom about any of it because she is so double sided on my mental health. She'll act all sweet one moment when I'm having a breakdown and then the next breakdown she's harsh. 

I cant take it any longer, I just want consistancy in people. I want a happy life. I want some reassurance in my family, but my life has become miserable and lonely. For the last hour the only thing I've been able to feel is the tight squeezing of the heartache in my chest. It makes my finger numb. I was sure I was going to end up having a heart attack.

I've been strong for so long... but everyone just sees me as weak. They think that back when I was pretending to be happy I was strong, even though that was when i was the weakest. I feel so alone. My thoughts are all over the place and it feels as though I'm just venting now... but I yearn so much for someone to call me strong or to acknowledge my hardships and see that I am trying... and not that I'm just some shitty little brat.

151,sad,"Hi, so I�ll keep this short. Basically over the last two years I�ve had a lot of big changes. I�ve changed medication, lost weight, changed diets, etc. the world has also been pretty wild over these past seven months. Needless to say, my mental health is considerable worse. I get randomly paranoid and obsessively, I�ve developed compulsive traits (both mental and psychical) and I have to be extremely careful not to see something that triggers an panic/anxiety attack. It�s becoming harder and harder to socialize because any little minor thing will throw me into an anxiety spiral. Simply put: I�m exhausted. I�ve already had to get off social media (for the most part) because people online trigger my social phobias. I�m currently speaking to a doctor to get these issues sorted out, but in the meantime, I�m curious to know if there�s anything I can do to soothe this.

153,sad,"Example, being told �You�re not entitled to sex� starts to feel like �You�re not worthy of sex�.

Being a 24 year old virgin, it really feels like a reinforcement of �never gonna happen, unless you pay a sex worker, at least�.

And what about love? Can�t buy that. What if I CAN get one, but not both together?

I�ve been told �You�re ugly as fuck� and other similar things by so many back in grade school, and by literally hundreds online. This is what makes it really feel like confirmation that I�m unfuckable, and unlovable. 

I hear too many mixed and contradicting opinions online, like �Embrace being single and celibate�, �Just wait for it to happen one day� (waste even more youth), �Get chemically castrated or on something to kill your libido� (I can�t help but feel that this might actually make me feel even worse? And it just sounds unhealthy. But if I have to be a �cuck� it�d be better if I could at least not care about it, right?), and of course �Just pay for it.�

I almost fell into inceldom, a group that claimed to be non-hateful incels (which was bs). They were just telling me to accept my fate, and making me further believe that I am somehow universally unattractive to the female race on a genetic level (that�s not possible, right?)

I�ve been told that I�m not entitled to ANYTHING. But food, shelter, healthcare, etc. Seem to at least be debatable, since you will literally die without them. This bothers me less, since I�ve never had to go without any of these and had them provided to me/accessible my whole life, but I could lose all that at any time too. 

The existence of real life 30-40+ year old virgins feels like reinforcement that I�ll be joining them if I�ve still never been able fi do it, because my life up until this point, points to their direction.

The existence of virgins losing it in their late 20s (older than me, but still in 20s) is KIND OF HOPEFUL, but that doesn�t prove I�ll be like them either.

Just waiting for life to happen seems like justification to not put in any effort, or maybe I�m misinterpreting that because I�m so sheltered and inexperienced at life and take things so literal.

Say I DO lose it within the next few years, or even this week (LOL, just an example, no way that�d happen, especially with the you know what virus going on), and me and her end up in a serious relationship. I don�t see it lasting, because I�ll constantly feel inferior (especially if she�s had multiple sexual partners before me) and wander about what I missed out on, sex with multiple partners, what that variety is like, before settling with one to be seriously together with.

I honestly see myself looking up and shooting the birds (my fingers) and yelling �TAKE THAT GOD/UNIVERSE/WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU ARE! FUCK YOUR PLAN FOR ME TO BE A LONELY VIRGIN! I TOOK CONTROL AWAY FROM YOU! IT�S MY LIFE MOTHERFUCKER! GO THROW A FUCKING FIT ABOUT IT! MY FATE MY CHOICE MOTHERFUCKER!!!!� and laughing like a hysterical maniac, after losing it. 

It�d be a victory against forces higher than me. But a lot of people�s contradictions about God or whatever have probably corrupted my view about God too, if there even is a God.

I know, I sound crazy. Just goes to show how ridiculous the concept of God, or the interpretation of God can be. No good God would send us to �Hell� for not believing in him without providing reason/proof to believe in Him....",-2

155,sad,"So quick non detailed background. I have PTSD, MDD and likely some other acronyms rattling around from just a whole bunch of stuff. I learned I was getting divorced in March and it�s been a struggle since then. I went off the rails for a while into depression and self loathing so, I felt like hell which makes sense.

Here is the bit that absolutely crushes me. I did my research, spoke to my therapist. About 3 months ago I started to regularly keep a gratitude journal, started a new art hobby, practice meditation, work out, eat a balanced healthy diet, sleep at least 8 hours a night....and I feel worse than I ever have. At this point I�m at a loss, I tried doing things in a healthy and unhealthy way both with the same result.

Love, Friends, family, career and god knows what else. Don�t really feel motivated to do anything in life. Just sit and play games and that�s pretty much what I�m doing. 

This results in fuckall sleep patterns, disturbed sleep, mood swings and most importantly absolute lack of motivation. Just feel like odds are stacked against me in every way possible. And cherry on the top is I live in a society where mental health is a joke. My own family just says take a day and then get better. I have no clue as to what to do. Even if I take up an activity it lasts for 3-5 days and then I relapse into the same cycle again. Sometimes I just feel I have no clue about what�s going on and I�m stuck in a middle of an absolute crisis.

I finished high school recently although I haven't been there in a good 3 months. The dropoff is real, I finally cut off all of the toxic people and that part is great but the pandemic is putting me in a bad situation as well.

My family doesn't have my social security card and I need one to get my ID, I want a job so bad to get my life on track and after many efforts to get it online, nothing has worked out and my family and I are waiting on the social security offices to open so we can go in ourselves.

It's been a long time and I've been 18 for a while now so I should have gotten a leg up in some way but my life is slipping slowly and I have such a bad sense of dread that I haven't reached the worst of it yet.

My girlfriend has started a job, is working on her promotion to manager, and has so many things going right for her that I am so proud because I was with her when she was at a similar low, helping her achieve her personal success.

So I'm socially disconnected from losing my friends, my girlfriend is doing amazing on her own which leaves me in a bad mess in comparison, I'm hopeless in regards of improving right now, and my mental state is being bombarded by my failiures. I'm acting different due to stress which I know affects my girlfriend and my family, and I am losing my ability to accurately reflect on my feelings and thoughts as well as I used to.

I have such a bad feeling of dread all the time, and I know that I'm dragging others down with me. I'm changing from being the person I loved and adored sharing with toher people I care about to a helpless husk, and I know I'm causing so many more problems than solutions, and I want to get out of this slump before it gets any worse.

163,sad,"This is a long one.
I (17m) have been friends with a girl (Let's call her N, her username starts with an n, all letters are based off usernames,) since I was 10 years old and she was 11. I've been through a lot with her, helping each other with our depressions and encouraging each other, she was always there for me, and I felt like we would be like this forever. 

Now, N is severely mentally ill. She grew up in an abusive and neglectful home, and felt like fictitious worlds and characters were the only constant in her life. She began to have dreams of interacting with them, and felt like they were her only friends. She believes that the person she is in the dreams (A shape shifting dragon who protects characters from their creators, she made up a whole world around it) is the ""real"" her and her actual body outside the dreams is merely a shell for it. 

It's gotten to the point where she cannot watch TV or play games due to feeling too connected to their characters, and grows depressed from nobody believing her. I only know this because she knew me long enough to trust me with it, she thinks I believe it's real, and honestly, I probably deserve this for not doing more to release her from it, but seeing how she firmly believed in it and refused to listen to anyone who says otherwise, I didn't feel like I had a choice.

N does lots of online roleplaying with her characters, and always has. I used to, but later only really did it to support her. An older friend of hers (P) who she (according to P) cut off all contact with after she didn't believe her dreams were real, reached out to her, and gave her a discord invite, wanting to get back in touch with her and saying that she missed roleplaying with her. I was interested and joined too. Now there were lots of people here, but the most important I'll call K and C. K was 19 when N was 17, and right off the bat relentlessly hit on her, and made explicit comments about her to her in private messages. She put up with this because she felt flattered by the attention. C has anxiety and didn't like K. Most of us didn't, but we were too scared to say anything because of how close he was to P. 

I for one always felt incredibly anxious there, and I was in a really bad place, right off the bat K hated my guts and saw me as a rival, I hated how he would talk about N, in front of everyone no less, and, after N invited me to a new server she made for close friends, walked in on them basically being really sexual before she nuked the server and apologised to me in dms. They had a big fight and N left the server, not because of K's sexual harassment of her, (which she apparently vented about to other female users in pms, according to C) but because he insulted her characters after he figured out she thought it was real. K also exploited her longing for the lover she has in her dream worlds. K got mad at me and accused me of turning everyone against him, we fought, and P banned me. 

N started a new server for the friends she made on the old one, including C and myself, and we bonded, I really felt a deep connection to them all. P also apologised for K's actions and started a new roleplay server. 

Now, it's a bit of an open secret that N is mentally ill. She takes the roleplay super seriously, and gets upset when people don't like her characters. And so, everyone else's characters practically worshipped the character that was meant to be her, and it got annoying to me after a while. C felt the same way, so we talked in pms. I'm an absolute asshole for doing this, but we complained about N a lot. Turns out she led C to a mental breakdown over her getting tired of playing a character she liked, but C never told anyone. So N never knew. We complained about how her characters could do no wrong, how I felt like she didn't care about me anymore, and all the times C felt like she was pressuring her to always be online and hold up to her expectations. Sometimes I felt like we were going too far, but kept it to myself for the most part. 

I felt bad for C, so I talked to N about it in pms. She got super depressed and scared that the others were scared of her, and were gonna leave her. I did my best to help her. Later in a voice chat C's stream cut out and N said things like: ""Hey C!"" ""You there?"" ""Miss you!"" In text. I was worried C might take that the wrong way, so I told her to please stop. She was silent for a while, then left. I told the others I was worried about N. 

Seeing how sad she was, not talking for about a day after that, I felt extremely guilty, and was offline for a few days. I came back today, and saw that N had vented. A few days ago. Saying I had pushed her into believing everyone hated her and was going to leave. C tried to defend me, saying I was stressed, and then she replied (copied to the best of my memory.)

N: ""Stressed about what?"" ""Making me cry myself to sleep?"" Leading me to catastrophize for days on end?"" ""(My name), we were supposed to be friends, you're not my father."" 

I read that, realised that to everyone on that server I was the bad guy now, and left the server entirely. I feel sick, I have no friends now, I am filled with self-loathing and just can't think of a way forward. I wish none of this ever happened.",-1

Sure I love being told I'm a peice of shit everyday. Sure, I love being told im useless everyday.

My fucking stomach is getting crushed by my god damn spine. I can't fucking eat more than a childs amount of food at a time. You all made fun of me tho for being skinny tho thanks friends. You try and going one month on my diet and see if you can have the energy to move. I fucking cant even get a fucking good job once in a while. I'm fucking slowly dying anyway, but I'll work harder and tell myself I'll be ok!! Thanks guys! Oh and I'm sorry your depressed too, I am. It fucking sucks. fucking tired of it. I fucking begged for some form of compassion because I dont want to fucking admit what I have to fucking deal with on a daily fucking basis and I'm sorry


Fuck this shit, I'm fucking tired of this fucking disgusting shit and I'm fucking NOT able to physically do anything fucking about it right now.

I'm fucking tired. I'm fucking tired. I'm fucking tired. 
I'm tired of my head and I want out. I'm a psycho and I'm aware of the road of loneliness I'm headed down.

But god damn is it better than being constantly lied to. Constantly told theres still better out there. Constantly told I'm not a motivated individual even though it's impossible to build something with only my heart involved.

I'm tired of being told I'm the one that's supposed to lead. I'm fucking tired of being told I'm the one that's supposed to be a man but then getting asked for space in return.

I'm tired of putting my emotions on the table only to not find out about someone 2 years down the road.

I'm tired of being told I can depend on family yet they are the one who bashed my head in and sent me to the hospital

I'm tired of being monogamous and finding out your fiance with 2 kids of 7 years admits shes polyamorous and when the new girl comes into my life 6 months down the road, she promised she was different but told me 2 years ago she was polyamorous. Then I tried for a year and she kicked me out homeless right before the coronavirus.

I get run out of everyone's lives so fast and obviously its because my mental health, but fuck. Governments got to get rid of the stigma of ""oh ask for help"" because what in the fuck does it do but have people tell you that it's going to be ok and then just dissapear? Lol. Where's the friends I drove around for free all those years in highschool. Now that I'm homeless none of them show up lol

Wheres my friends when i constantly put their well being before mine? Wheres my friends when i paid for whatever they wanted without asking to be repaid?

Wheres my friend i once drove to woodstock during college because he missed his mom? Oh and drove home without asking for gas money and went back a week later to pick him up.

Why am I always told I should stop being me so I can stop being depressed? How about some of you show compassion like you all say you do in all these fucking statuses of world events you all seem to seem ""worthy of a profile picture banner""

I was told by someone that I shouldnt be upset no one came to my aid because you dont know their situation.
Yeh I do get that, but shit there are some of you on here I really really thought I'd at least get a message from by now.

I'm tired of being the first to always offer myself to be fucked in the end.

I dont know what this status is about but I know it's what constantly fucks with my head

173,sad,"
Why can�t I (19F) just have fun with something intellectually challenging without taking it so personally? 

I just came home from an escape room with my sister (13F). She seemed to have some fun, but for the most part, I was frustrated out of my mind. By the end, I wanted to hurt her and the staff. Badly.

This happens every time. My sister seems to love them, and dad (40M) emotionally pressures me into going with her since it requires at least two people. 

My sister lives with my egg donor, and she only visits periodically. I try to treat her as well as I possibly can in the limited amount of time we spend together, but I�m very short with her in escape rooms, and I feel like I�m part of the reason why she gets so stressed out in them, too�my bad mood has a history of being rather contagious.

For some reason, these things make me so quick to anger. Before I ever went into an escape room, I thought it would be something fun and a little challenging. My intelligence is something
I�m very proud of, and it�s helped me to face many obstacles with confidence. 

I endured a lot of abuse when I was younger that was mainly psychological in nature, so in order to push back and survive, I needed to outsmart many people, many of which were considerably older and more powerful than me, so I consider my brain to be no joke. I feel like there�s almost no challenge I can�t face in that sense. 

But escape rooms? For some embarrassing reason, I just can�t handle them. I can�t handle the idea of being stumped so badly (and while other people are watching, no less).

At the end of every escape room, one of the staff will come into the room with you and show you how it�s done if (when) you don�t escape. And every single time, it�s only makes me more upset. Either parts of the puzzle are so easy that I feel like an idiot for not figuring them out, or they�re so complex that I can�t comprehend how ANYONE could solve them. It makes me angry at myself and everyone else in equal measure. 

The most horrible part is that being unable to solve escape room puzzles totally depletes my self-esteem. It�s like my brain is screaming at me, �Why can�t you do this? Why are you so stupid? It�s probably the weed. It�s make you a moron, now. It�s too late. Your brain is worthless. You might as well die. How are you going to navigate the most basic aspects of adulthood if you can�t even do this? You�re a pathetic, worthless piece of shit. People lied to you when they said you were smart; they wanted to lead you into a false sense of security. You can�t even be nice to your sister in a wittle escape room? Aww, does baby want her bottle? Your identity is a lie. You�re not smart. You�re a failure.�

And these thoughts are so �loud� that I can�t block them out, and they make me fall into a spiral of depression and fury so strong that I can�t even describe it much further than that.

Now, I�m completely exhausted, my face feels hot to the touch, and I want to kill myself. Again.

I want to enjoy this. Every time she and I have gone to one of these things, I try to force myself to have fun and to not get too emotionally invested, but I can�t. I end up thinking so poorly of myself that I contemplate finding a way to commit suicide right there in the room. 

The anger that I feel... It�s stronger than my own body. I lose everything about myself except for the anger. And I feel so helpless because I can�t channel it into anything healthy when I�m trapped in a room full of confusing puzzles with a ticking timer. 

I don�t know how to feel better right now... I�m so tired that I don�t even have the strength to eat. Tying this was a little hard, too, but I had to get this off my chest. I feel miserable�nihilistic, even. I�m regretting everything I�ve ever done in life, and wondering if I�ll ever be able to properly navigate adulthood if I can�t even keep my emotions in check.

174,sad,"Hi friends, 

This is a throwaway account and I�ve never talked to anyone about this, but it�s something that still affects me deeply, years after the fact. I�m mostly just looking for reassurance, if not a �name� for what happened. It wasn�t rape, as I didn�t say no or very clearly withdraw consent. But I wanted to super often.

Basically, from high school to early college I was in a relationship with a boy for whom I had to do a lot of emotional labor, before I knew what that was. He had a hard home life and was remarkably well-adjusted considering, but I always felt like more of a safety blanket than a truly valued partner. 

Important context is that I was a very shy teenager. I still struggle to stick up for myself in one-on-one relationships, but I�ve gotten much better since. He often ignored boundaries I tried to gently set, like personal space, staying past when I wanted him to leave, etc. I always felt incredibly guilty for that. I value personal space, and I�d always have to ask him 3-4 times �when are you thinking of heading out?� �I should get to bed� etc. before he�d even consider leaving. Even when I�d have panic attacks and desperately needed space, he�d say �I don�t understand why my being here isn�t helping.� It took A LOT for me to even stick up for myself, and when I did he�d just argue and ignore it.

I didn�t know what to tell him, and I internalized a lot of that by thinking I just wasn�t a very giving girlfriend. But I slowly started to resent spending time with him/being on close proximity to him because of it. Even when we�d be sleeping in the same bed, he�d grab at my chest and just pull me in in a semi-sexual way when I was absolutely not into it. I began physically recoiling from him as instinct, and I still have issues when my current boyfriend touches my chest. 

Anyway, the sex began to feel very one-sided, and being the shy teen I was, I didn�t know how to say anything, and I very much felt like it was me being a dysfunctional partner if I didn�t commit to regular sex. Here�s the important part: I don�t remember a time I ever said �no� and he continued sex. But SO often he�d grab me or do something much smaller and I�d have to say �stop� multiple times before he�d stop. There were boundary and consent issues, but it didn�t feel that serious at the time because it was little things like touching me too much or grabbing at me when I tried to pull away. My mind didn�t really register that as bad, but my body definitely did. 

We both had a very hard time communicating about deeply emotional/intimate stuff - which I don�t believe was entirely our faults, as we were young and fairly shy. So we didn�t talk about sex. It just became something I decided to endure. I have very vivid memories of just laying there, my face turned away, just clenching my jaw and waiting for him to be done. I�d try to hide some of the discomfort - but another part of me is still grappling with WHY he didn�t see that I was uncomfortable/in pain/ just enduring. He had to have known to some degree. I�d sometimes cry after sex because it felt so intimately violating. He�d hold me. But it all felt very retroactive, like he�d continue to do it and handle the fallout afterward. Idk. 

After a while this became normal for me, and there were a couple times where he�d bend me over (so my face was sort of hidden - that was a consensual position) and I�d start to panic so much that tears would be streaming down my face, but I told myself �you just need to let him finish.� Of course, when he saw that I was crying he�d feel bad & hold me. But we wouldn�t really talk about it. I felt totally unable to bring it up. 

All of this, coupled with the fact that he cheated on me in a very out-of-left-field, gaslight-y, painful way the year prior fed into the panic and silencing I felt. 

But again, I never verbally withdrew consent. 

About a year after we broke up, though, I started having pretty dramatic flashbacks and panic attacks, all centered around sex and feeling totally out of control of my own body. It�s still with me to this day - about 5 years after the fact, and it�s become a regular problem in my new relationship (with a really lovely, open partner). I panic and cry a lot during sex. I hate it. I hate him, honestly, and I wish I could make this go away. I hate that it feels like he still has some level of control over my body. 

But, he has no idea. He doesn�t know he ever did anything wrong by me, let alone that I�m dealing with this trauma years out. Haven�t spoken to him in years. And even though I hate him when this stuff comes back up, I do believe he�s a good guy and I wish him well. It�s hard to explain. He really just doesn�t know.

Basically, I�m really struggling with how to identify and address this, because I can�t even justify my feelings to myself. It wasn�t rape, it likely wasn�t assault because I didn�t feel confident enough to communicate or withdraw consent (I still don�t know if I WOULD have if I knew how - I felt such a responsibility to just get it done and over with). It�s a lot of gray area, and I go back and forth between �he didn�t know� and �how the fuck could he not have known?� 

Does anyone have a similar experience or any kind of advice on how to identify/make peace with this kind of trauma? (Calling it trauma still feels disingenuous to me - but it causes me physical panic attacks, so....)",-2
175,sad,She is luckily in remission now and I am forever thankful. She was only 48 when she was diagnosed and it broke my heart. It is just her and I and she is my everything. Every since day I worry about her. She is still weak from the medicine she has to take for a few years. I�m always scared something will happen on her way to work or home from work. I stay up in the mornings until it is time for her to have arrived at work and anxiously wait when I know she has left work. I cry nearly everyday thinking about it.

I fear the coronavirus deeply because she is immunocompromised. I am so tired of feeling this way. I feel broken-hearted when I see her and I want to feel happy around her. How do I heal?,-2
176,sad,"So I always here about setting boundaries for yourself and others. I guess I understand what that is supposed to do, like keeping you out of uncomfortable situations or triggers away.
But, for a recent example, my mother wants to go on a vacation and we would have to fly to get there. I'm not sure how it is elsewhere but where I'm from it's allowed to do that to certain places but only with masks on during the entire thing. And here comes the problem I hate wearing masks an have severe social anxiety that already creates problems for me during flights and the restricted air flow can make me panic easily. But since I don't have a physical problem with the masks I'm not allowed to stay home.
Now to my actual question.
I have tried setting boundaries many times from privacy to people who have made me uncomfortable but everyone just ignored me and I don't know what to do and how to go about this, now that it could end up with me having, as a worst-case scenario a panic attack or quite possibly at least a crying fit in a place I can't leave to calm down for up to 3h.",-1
177,sad,"I've been struggling with ADHD since i was very young. I stopped taking my medication around 3 years ago when i started to have problems with addiction. The first 2 years were unproblematic. I had no struggle, calmed myself using some unconventional methods. 
Recently, everything started to worsen. I'm losing focus when talking, my mind literally goes blank and I don't notice when people start talking to me. I don't really know what to do, whom to talk to. That stuff is really making me worried. I haven't slept more than 2 hours a day for the last month. I almost lost my job, and had a fight with my best friend because I can't concentrate anymore. Has anyone experienced related things?",-2
178,sad,Can someone tell me what this feeling comes from where I get so angry and irritated to the point I turn it on myself and will talk myself down and just bawl. I mean I feel hopeless and irritated and I hate myself to the point I look into the mirror in tears and tell myself how shitty I am. I already know my irritation stems from anxiety but I don't understand where the hatred towards myself comes from,-1
179,sad,"It�s nearing midnight and I can�t sleep because I�m struggling to get my thoughts and anxiety in check. Even though I haven�t interacted with this community before, just being able to read the supportive comments and the kind interactions between complete strangers makes me cry. I�ve been feeling lonely for a while now and this pandemic situation plus the nighttime just makes everything worse but I find comfort here. 

I�ve been struggling with getting over mistakes I did in the past, been thinking about my mortality a lot, and I just overall feel that I�m inside a dream of sorts. Relationships have wilted and I don�t talk to many people anymore. To be honest I�ve never had any best friend or any relationship that felt deep enough. I struggle to find help and the one time I tried to tell someone about this, they just called it lame. Well, either way I really thank y�all for listening to others and helping them in any way, shape or form, no matter how big or small. Thanks!",-1
180,sad,"I'm just sitting in a car park in my car outside of an emergency psychiatric hospital with crippling anxiety, borderline panic attack that I have had since around 8am (11.30 pm right now). Feels like I'm going to throw up, my chest and back is hurting so bad, my arms and hands are tingling and I'm feeling dizzy. 

I have taken anxiety medication with no results but I need to work tomorrow cause I need the money since I only have work for a maximum of 8 more weeks with this week included. I need someone to talk to but I don't want to walk in and end up staying for two weeks like last time. I am also in completely the wrong clothing (full welding gear but without the mask), knives and tools are my pockets full of and I don't want to spent time emptying my pocket and risking loosing my stuff.

Can someone help.",-2
182,sad,"Before I go into the full on vent, here's some context: 

- I'm not officially diagnosed however I'm trying to be and this is the conversation I had with my dad less than an hour before making this post.

- I consulted a college phychologist about ADHD, about a month or two before lockdown started, she said she can't 'formally' diagnose me but there is a high chance that I'm correct in my suspicion and there's also a chance that I have aspergers.

- I know I might make it sound bad, but my dad IS trying to be understanding (more so than my mum), he just believes mental health is 'made up' and 'all in your head'. Old fashioned, basically, and is convinced that there's nothing wrong with me and that I'm just believing everything I read on the Internet.

- This is translated and paraphrased from Polish because that's the language me and my dad speak. 

I'm trying to convince my parents to allow me to see a professional and get formally diagnosed and possibly put on some treatment, particularly about ADHD because it's started to seriously affect my college life. This is where today's conversation came in.

I've brought it up with my dad a few times already but I feel like he's dodging the topic, telling me ""yeah talk to your aunt she knows a phychologist"" but not understanding that I want him to sort me out an appointment because one, I'm 17 so I don't think I can get an appointment myself (I Think, I live in the UK but am currently in Poland and my parents would rather me see a Polish professional), and two, I'm too anxious to make the phone call myself and I do want him to be a part of this because I need him to understand.

But today I think I finally convinced him through a very painful conversation. Basically, we got into a bit of a spat earlier today regarding my anti-social spouts, and that I think he takes everything too personally because ""No, I'm not ignoring you on purpose, I just get lost in my own head and don't want to talk or interact sometimes. Sometimes I just dissociate.""

He wants me to constantly be smiling and takes it to heart when I just don't talk or 'seem sad' even though half (Actually like 80%) of the time I'm just thinking/over-thinking and I do have a bit of a resting b*tch face ngl. In all honesty, I don't smile that much, but not because I'm sad it's just I don't feel the need and don't want to. Same goes for constantly having to maintain conversation or ""Behave like I'm happy.""

I started tearing up before I even started the conversation, because I can't handle conflict and I was afraid of how he'll react. I continued to almost cry and aggressively claw at my hand throughout (I can't deal with huge amounts of emotion and start stimming really heavily when I'm even remotely anxious).

I always knew about the ADHD, I just didn't have a name to it until mid-highschool, but I've researched some on Aspergers/autism and noticed that a handful of symptoms align with my behaviour. I told him about a few symptoms I've seen in myself E. G:

Excessive Stimming. Leg shaking, scratching (myself, though that one is mostly when anxious), random snapping of fingers, imitating random noises (Like alarms or animals), and the worst which he can't tell me he doesn't see because he nags me for it almost daily: Pacing. And when I say pacing I mean spending hours walking from wall to wall lost in my own head with headphones, occasionally if I have a particularly intense daydream I tend to 'bounce' off the walls or imitate a few actions in my daydream. 

I've had trouble focusing since childhood, I'd spent lessons in primary zoned out and by the end I wouldn't even remember what happened. It was usually the only thing teachers complained about me. In high school it kinda got better but not really because I still had to constantly snap myself out of daydreams and try really hard not to fall asleep or space out. However, no one ever thought anything of it because I was a 'gifted' kid and tbh I didn't either. I got really good grades in the end but by that age I was starting to become more conscious that the amount of times I lose focus or how I behave in some cases is not normal. 

High emotional sensitivity, leading to an inability to compromise which is the root of 90% of our arguments. I can't argue face to face for the f*cking life of me, even if I know I'm going into a calm debate I just get overly emotional and it affects my ability to form coherent arguments. 

Issues socialising, I only really have two real friends and I don't talk to most people unless spoken to. I'm not on speaking terms with anyone but one of my classmates. I don't catch some social cues, over-share, over-think and over-analyse people's responses, don't know how to start or continue a conversation without the other person doing a fair share of leading the conversation. Dislike of eye contact. An aversion to physical contact, not always, I can get clingy occasionally but like a good 75% of the time I cringe. Heck, even with my own family I sometimes feel unnecessarily awkward. I'm mortified to make important phone calls. Constantly worried about people's opinion of me and seeking out approval. I tend to go into anti-social bouts where I don't wish to be interacted with in any way and would prefer to be left on my own. If I'm already in public, it shows as me being quiet and not contributing at all to the social event going on around me. 

Though this one is a bit of a paradox, because I DO experience spouts of becoming a social butterfly and once you get me started on a topic I'm currently passionate about I don't shut up to the point I tend to over-step what's an acceptable amount to explain. And my dad thinks that is the 'normal' side of me, that I'm normally in the 'social butterfly' mode and that's what he wants me to be all the time. He's starting to get the fact that I need my alone time and that I'm not always a social butterfly, but it makes me incredibly guilty to see him be bothered by my anti-social bouts. 

I want to say I've experienced a few 'special interests' especially as a child and even a few now BUT I'm not so sure on that topic and whether it truly applies to me.

Those are the ones most prominent I've noticed in me.

My dad passes most of those off as normal behaviour, chalking it up to me being a hormonal teenager and that once I'm an adult I'll grow out of all this. Here's the thing though: What if I don't? If I grow up and have it worse as an adult because I didn't do anything about it now? I already went completely under the rader as a kid, one because I was a 'gifted child' and two my parents don't believe in mental illness.

I didn't bring this topic up until high school because I simply didn't have a name to it, nor did I really know or care much about mental health. I'm not claiming to be an expert or anything, but I know what it's like to live inside my own head and can recognise that not everything I do and the way I think is normal. But because ""nothing was wrong with me before"" and ""suddenly you've come up with all these problems that you never mentioned before"" and ""I don't see anything wrong with you"" ""You've been influenced by your friends and the Internet"" ""You don't know what you're talking about"". He thinks that I've convinced myself to having these problems, because I just searched it up on the Internet and cherry picked what applies to me. 

And let's say that OK, maybe I have convinced myself because I've read too much sh*t on the Internet. Isn't it better to see a professional and find out anyway? To finally settle this once and for all instead of me wondering if there's something wrong with me? 

That's kinda what I finally convinced him with, he still thinks there's nothing wrong with me. I feel like I have ruined his holiday though, he was supposed to relax now that he can't really work during the pandemic. He told me how he ""misses the old times when I was a child and would always be smiling and enjoy holidays together without any emotional baggage or problems."" 

He's a good parent and I know he genuinely cares about me but is just incredibly ignorant on the topic of mental health and convinced that it doesn't really exist. (Like he gets everything else right as a dad BUT THIS.)",-1
183,sad,"I hate how some people think that having a mental illness is a trait or its somehow trendy. I also absolutely hate it when people throw around words loosely like ""depressed"", ""I'm so OCD, I need to arrange my pencils in a certain order"" ,"" I didnt eat this morning, I think I have anorexia"". It actually hurts coz it's so much harder to deal with when u actually suffer from it and u know the pain. 

Mental health used to be such a taboo topic. No one even discussed it a few years ago and now u see people joking around about it and romanticizing it. I joke around about suicide and depression coz I feel like I can cope better but when jokes are unnecessarily made, it pisses me off. 

I remember in our psychology class the teacher would always poke fun at the kids who were sleeping and srsly ask them if they had autism which doesn't even remotely make sense but everyone starts laughing as if it's funny, it just feels weird coz I'm actually on the spectrum or my own teacher would tell ppl to go hang themselves and she would have a straight serious face. Her teaching was excellent but she made fucking hippocratic ""jokes"" that she apparently thought were funny. 

I had a friend who wasnt depressed or suicidal or anything. But one day she noticed my self harm scars and told me that they looked cool and beautiful like wat..... and the next day she made self harm scars in designs like drawing carved lightly on her skin and went around the school showing it off. I honestly didnt know what to think of this imao. 

I remember when 13 reasons why came out I fucking loved the show. It was the only show that I had come across which actively talked about mental health and I was so excited and ofcourse i wasnt gonna listen to the warning pfft. The show was rly good. It was my favourite at the time. But I remember crying after every episode and cutting after every episode and attempted suicide after the show, ended up in the ICU came back to life obviously. This was obviously not because of the show, I had already been diagnosed with severe depression along with a few other mental illnesses. It was honestly my fault for watching it despite the warning. However, now I feel that the show did glorify suicide for eg:by showing hannah reacting to the people mourning after her death. Like when u die, ur gonna be gone. U won't know that people will fucking miss u. U wont fucking be there to see how ppl will react after ur death. It almost inserts a false perception into ur head. But I love how it openly talked about mental health issues that needed to be talked about but it was still romanticizing suicide in a way. 

People need to realize that mental health is the same as physical health and it's about time ppl look at both mental and physical health equally. 

Sorry I'm not a good writer and I might have said some stuff that doesn't make sense or is illogical. I didnt write everything I feel coz Idk how to put them in writing but this is all I could get out and I feel like this topic is very important",-2

185,sad,"I�ve been mentally ill what seems to me my entire life. I believe it began around the age of 5 when talks started of my parents splitting and later exacerbated after being molested by my neighbor when I was in the 4th grade. 

Ever since then, I�ve never had mental stability and as I age, it has done nothing but get worse. My boyfriend is my only beacon of unconditional support but even then he misses the mark sometimes. I�ve tried to seek help both professionally and personally, and unfortunately I haven�t had a breakthrough.

As a black woman, I find it rather discouraging to talk about mental health because those around me are consumed with the idea that black people aren�t mentally ill and that it�s a �white trait� and I think everyone on this thread white, black, or other etc. can attest that�s not true. 

Every time I mention mental health and depression, I get met with �it�s all in your head,� or �toughen up,
life sucks�, or the most famous line as well as obnoxious �just pray about it�. It�s extremely agonizing to hear those responses and they have no clue about your suicide attempts, sleepless nights, self-harm episodes, or how a boy almost twice your age, groomed you into a victim because he knew no one would listen. The worst part is that he was right.",-2

187,sad,"I'm just writing this to let it out.. I do not expect anyone to respond to this i just wanna, idk, ask into the void that's called the internet haha.

I'm 20 now. My doctor and psychologist told me 2 years ago that i was fine. I was cured of my depression. I didn't self harm that often (I'm clear now) and my mood was a little better.

And for a little while i felt better. 6 months ago i moved in by my boyfriend. And around 3 months ago the negative thinking came back. Wenn im alone i just cry.. I cry in my bed with nothing on my mind.

I don't have a reason to be sad. I don't know why i feel this way, i was suppose to be cured.. Wenn i tell my boyfriend (this isn't to often because i don't wanna be irritating or a stupid child that cries over everything) he comforts me and tells me that i just need to let go more. Just let my thoughts go. But i don't know how.

I have no idea how to help myself and i don't want to ask him for help over and over again. My bf thinks i don't need a psychologist or anything because it isn't that kind of problem in my head and i just need a little peace in my head. But idk what i need or what i feel. I have no idea what this feeling of emptiness is. I just feel nothing.. Just like 2 years ago.. I don't wanna be that depressed girl again..

Well this is a long enough rend into the void for today.

I hope you are feeling better than me.

188,sad,"Over the past couple of months I�ve been experiencing a feeling of fear!!

I was fired from my job in January for calling in sick. On 2 different occasions. Really knocked me for six. Yesterday I drove up upon a horrific car wreck, trained in first aid I assisted until first responders arrived. 

One didn�t make it, I didn�t even need to touch the person to know. But I did check for a pulse just to be sure. (RIP) 

Then all of a sudden it hit me!! Bam my mother died 6 years ago and watching her died hit me all over again, now I never broke down but the feeling I wanted to. They say once you see death it never leaves you. This is true!! 

Yet another death my partner father of my 2 children 17+15 a very tragic accident. This hit me really hard my children too. My eldest will be 18 this year and I have nothing for him. 

Things drastically changed in my life and I cut off everything and everyone from my life, not completely now but still cut off. I stopped going out I stopped applying for jobs for the fear of rejection at my age! Stopped going out socially stopped meeting with friends for lunch/dinner. 

I am on medication I find it helps but it�s like there�s something missing, I�ve no energy tired most of the day and no get up and go feeling..

189,sad,"My whole family is super ignorant and they are all such narcissists, i live and ""spend"" most of my time with my mother and i'm really starting to get tired of her bullshit. 

This honestly goes out to anyone who has children because if you'll treat them this way then you have no right to say that you are the victim in the situation, ignorance should not be excused if you don't even want to educate yourself. 

I show severe signs of depression and anxiety. Now about 3 or 4 months ago my mother found out about my harming scars which even at that time were already at least 3 months old, threw a tantrum at me because she thought i wanted to die when as you all know and understand, self harm isn't really the same as suicide, especially not in my case. I was doing it to release all of the emotional weight off myself, on top of the fact that i believed and even still believe that i deserved that pain, but no, that woman won't ever just shut up and listen. 
This sense of entitlement that i've seen a lot of parents even today have, its so fucking toxic that if your child honestly starts hating you, you have absolutely no right to call them spoiled or shit kids, because this is your fault, especially if you were given the chance to change and educate yourself on the matter many times in the past. 

My depression wasn't caused by interacting with certain friends mom, it wasn't caused because i read about it IN ORDER to educate myself. My depression isn't just laziness or me being a spoiled teenager who's life is just so great that it gets boring so i just decided to spice things up one day. Do i know more about it than you? Yes i do, because i decided to not stay shallow and be like you, i decided to educate myself on it, which is apparently too much to ask for from a person that was supposed to take every little bit of responsibility for me when you decided to give birth to me. And no, you don't get a thank you for getting me help, its your job to do that as my mother, it is the bare minimum, just like it is to get me the necessary medical help or clothes or food or a roof under my head. And no, I'm not trying to ""embarrass"" you by telling you that youre not doing what you should be doing. Grow the fuck up people, its never late to change out of this stubborness.",-2
190,sad,"I suffer from OCD. I take anti-depressants for about a week now. And I'm supposed to start CBT next week. But I can't stop these thoughts. I stream on twitch and kn youtube.

I feel this pain in my chest every time and it hurts so fucking badly.
I'm scared that my channel will die or something. I am scared that I won't be able to create content not because of my own limits.

191,sad,"Context: 17F, 18 in a month, living in the US. Going to university in September.

I feel like somethings wrong with me. One of the main reasons is how I react to stress or frustration. When I get frustrated, I tend to harm myself (thankfully not by cutting, I can resist that urge) by punching myself in the face or back of the head repeatedly. If I�m around others I pull my hair. Something about that releases frustration for me, and I never leave visible bruises so I don�t really see a problem with it. Then I cry like a baby afterward and it�s embarrassing, even though I�m alone 90% of the time when I get like that. After the breakdown I either get a rush of adrenaline or feel drained and empty. 

Another thing is the way I socialise. I can�t tell when I�ve said something offensive or rude until the person gets mad and stops talking to me. And even then I have to ask what I said wrong. I also stutter a lot, have to repeat myself, and backtrack to make sure what I said made sense. I tend to obsess over fictional universes (Steven Universe is a huge obsession right now, going on 8 months) and annoy my friends because that�s literally all I talk about, especially if they have no clue what it is. Social events are hell for me because fandoms are the only way I can connect with people, so if it�s an event with mainly adults or little kids, I feel alone and awkward. 

I flinch at loud noises, sudden movements, and slight touches despite having never been hit or abused in any way. I�ve searched every memory from the time I was a little kid and can�t remember a single time I was hit maliciously (fights with my brother don�t count because we never went for each other�s faces).

Physically I use my hands as a nervous habit a lot. Years ago I realised that when I walk, my arms hang like everyone else�s but felt wrong, so now I constantly play with my hands. Cracking knuckles, moving my fingers around, snapping, and even digging my nails into my skin are my main nervous habits. If I�m really stressed or anxious I bite my fingers.

There�s a lot more but this is already pretty long and incoherent, so I�ll spare you guys the trouble. But from this post, does it sound like something�s wrong and I should find a therapist? Or am I overthinking this entirely and I�m normal?",-1
192,sad,"So, this will be a long one but thanks for reading.

About 4 years ago my Mother was diagnosed with ALS and given maybe a year to live. Me, my Dad and my Sister were there to support her for the next 9 months as she slowly stopped being able to talk and to eat on her own. The ALS really only effected her mouth and throat. After about 9 months she eventually ended up vomiting, aspirating it, and getting a severe repository infection. Her immune system couldn�t keep up anymore and she died.

Ever since then I have temporarily dropped out of high school at grade 11 because of the stress it was causing me. I have been to a few different councillors and have been on Prozac for depression for a while. About two years ago I came off the Prozac and seemed okay.

It is now 6 days till the 3rd anniversary of her death and for the last 2 weeks I have been cripplingly afraid of dying. Not of when it will happen but of the endless nothingness afterward. I know that it is somewhat irrational but my brain keeps saying it isn�t.

Over the last week I have gotten slightly better by just talking to my Dad and my consultant that I�ve known for 8 years and I am trying to make an appointment with another councillor. But with COVID-19 it is getting pretty difficult to get into somewhere.

Luckily, I haven�t been suicidal at any point.

I mentioned to my Dad yesterday that it might be some sort of PTSD from the 9 month period because any time I hear death mentioned I have what is basically a small panic attack. I have not been in contact with anyone outside my family for the last 6 months but I�m not very social anyway.

I came here hoping someone has some advice or maybe had even been in the same sort of situation before. If you have any questions please feel free to ask.

193,sad,"\[22M Australia\]

Long story short, I give up as soon as I can to go back to doing nothing (gaming, internet etc). College took a break for Coronavirus and tried to do online stuff but didn't do a good job of it. I saw the opportunity and ""sub-consciously"" took it. I say that with quotes because I barely feel like I'm making logical decisions anymore, my body just says words and I live with the consequences later . I put in a letter of 'paused study' which means I take a break and pick up next semester. Studying online felt rough since I kept having to ask the lecturer questions on almost anything that we covered and even then I wasn't getting it.

My mum is extremely disappointed since she knows she didn't raise me with those kinda morals and she's right she didn't but I can't pull myself out of the 16 year long depression that I've been in. Every opportunity I've ever had has been screwed up either by me or by random circumstances. I lost all motivation to continue and I just can't be bothered with anything outside of gaming etc. Mum's put a lot of effort into motivating me with stuff and occasionally asks me how getting back into college is going, which I just get mad at her and try and shift the blame or attention somewhere else (either to a lecturer or an email not getting replied to).

That leads to tonight where she broke down and said she can't do it anymore. This has happened before and its for the same reasons. But this time felt different as she asked me what I wanted to do with my life, truly. I told her I don't want to do anything, I don't like the world with the people in it they're all greedy and self-centered etc etc. I understand there's some people out there who aren't like that but they are almost always superseded by a dozen of others. I told her I didn't want to live in that world and she said ""You want to kill yourself!?"" to which I agreed. I remember that since I was about 6 I was sitting in the bath with her next to me as ""I cried out I don't wanna live anymore"". I didn't think much of it but I noticed she immediately got more upset.

She got up and walked away and I followed her out. She turned to me and said ""Fine I'll say it. Kill yourself if you want to. I know that's what you've been waiting for someone to say"". It's true, it hit me hard but its true. I had been waiting 16 years for someone I loved to seriously tell me that. But as soon as she said it she started crying since, well, no mother should feel like they have to say those words. She walked away again and I followed her and gave her a hug as she told me how I keep blaming others and getting mad at her for trying to help. About wasted potential and squandered opportunity.

I just, I can't ever care about anyone other than myself. I don't feel empathy or sympathy towards other people, I don't get happy or sad. I used to get angry but that's dialed back a lot in the last few years. I think the best way to describe my emotions is ""disappointed"" and ""not-disappointed"". If someone says they're going to do something and they do it, I'm not disappointed in that even if they did a great job on it I still feel the same. If they don't do it then I'm disappointed and I just try and forget that we ever had an interaction and go back to doing 'nothing'. When I'm doing 'nothing', my mind is focused on the task at hand and I don't have time for emotions. I just do what I think will progress me to more content either something good to watch or best decision in a video-game.

I've done a couple jobs and courses around the place, work for the dole type deals. None have lasted more than a year and the first study I chose to do I didn't finish since I missed one assignment and they said I had to redo it, so surprise I didn't do it. I once had to move up north of the city (am currently south of it) for some work with a random company who promised a short course and guaranteed work at the end. I spent 3 months with them and then 1 week with a ""sister company"" for $150. They lied about work and the qualification they provided wasn't anything besides manual labour. When I asked them about the work they pawned me off to the owner's sister's friend's company who lied about how I didn't need my license.

I do stuff around the house, I'm respectful to guests and the rest of the family here. Mum says I'm a smart guy who could do well if he put in the effort. I'm taking medication that seemed to improve me from who I was before I started taking it. I've seen I believe 7 psychologists and nothing much has come of it besides the medication and saying how I don't have Borderline Personality Disorder.

I don't know what to expect from this lengthy post, its a vent but its also an admission of guilt. Guilt I feel is about how I'm emotionally a void. I cry when others cry or talk about something I've done in the past I'm not proud of. I don't remember the last time I was happy, only the times when something has made me laugh. We all make mistakes but I don't know how to fix this one.

No I'm not going to kill myself.

194,sad,"(M25) I have been doing really great of late. Eating right, getting enough sleep, working out and started a consistent routine. I'm happy.

But now the trade school I have been attending is resuming the suspended classes due to covid19 and I'm flooded with anxiety and thoughts of inadequacy.i can't pinpoint what in anxious about whether is failure or the fact I have extra responsibility or the change. 

I don't want this to get in the way of all the progress I've made in the last 5 weeks but I'm struggling with these intense feelings of anxiety.",-1
195,sad,"Hi all,

I�m near the end of high school in Australia and I�m finding myself in a difficult place. Until a year ago, I was doing very well in school and I expected to do very well last year and this year, but I didn�t. The problems I�ve faced include:
- Perfectionism resulting in procrastination due to inability for every assignment to be perfect
- Executive dysfunction (this has always been a problem but I�ve reached the point where the work is difficult enough that this impacts my grades)
- Emotionally abusive household
- Burnout

I try my hardest despite these but I�ve repeatedly failed and others have berated me for it, making me feel I don�t deserve to exist. But not only am I scared of failure, I�m also scared of success. I don�t like being praised or otherwise knowing that I�m doing well from others (grades, money, etc.) because it makes me feel like I�m being moulded and manipulated into what someone else wants me to be - not *who I am.*

I don�t want to be a drone, but I don�t to be a failure. I don�t want to freeload, but I don�t want to work. I don�t want to be pathetic, but I don�t want to be successful. I don�t want to be traumatised, but I don�t want to heal because I don�t know what I feel and think besides all of the negative thoughts.

But, I don�t know what I *do* want, either. I�ve recently come to the realisation that all my dreams and aspirations are really just my interpretation of what I think others expect of me and I never really wanted to do any of it. Still, I don�t have something I want to do besides all this. I�m not even one of those kids who has the wild daydream fantasy of playing video games for a living - I can�t imagine a single thing that I *want* to do.

About the only thing I think I want is to move out of home to escape my condescending parents, and that�s about it. I have no additional plans besides working a job that I haven�t decided on and finding a close friend to heal with.

**How do I learn to look inwards and discover who I am; who I want to be; what my identity is?** I don�t know who I am and I don�t know who I want to be. I can�t even describe or know my interests, my goals (besides that immediate one), my personality, or even my *gender* and I don�t know how I will discover them. All I see when I look inwards is a pathetic, hurt wreck, but I know that that�s not me - that�s my trauma.

Also, **how can I decide that success is a good thing and get over my fear of it, including my fear of being successful at healing?** Yes I am scared of success, but I know that I�ll be happier once I�m not because if I aspire to be successful, I�ll have more money or more spare time or more happiness or whatever it is that I discover that I want. I�m even scared of being successful at overcoming my trauma, and the dilemma between healing and not healing has kept me awake at night.

I just want the pain to be over. I didn�t ask for any of this.",-2

198,sad,"I don�t even know where to begin. I have spent many, many years trying to work out how to just live like a functional person. I�m 20 now and living with my boyfriend and from the outside all is well, I have two cats and live with someone I love, my family is relatively sane for the most part and while I don�t have more than one or two friends they�re lovely and I love them. The problem is, all of it feels fake. 

I feel like I�m on an entirely separate plane of existence from everyone else. I�m constantly on edge and, when I�m not in a massive depressive slump that renders me nearly immobile for days, I�m uptight, anxious and constantly stressed. I�ve been getting treatment for anxiety and depression for years now but it all feels like a dead end. Every time I tell my family I�m depressed their only advice is to ask for a new medication. I�m fucking sick of meds. I�ve been on countless meds since I was 12 for one thing or another and I hate them. The ones I�m on right now make me vomit if I don�t eat a full meal before taking them. 

I only ever have about as much energy as it takes to get from my bed to the bathroom every day, let alone work and eat and do functional people things, but no one seems to take me seriously. It�s always �man that sucks� or �I feel that� or �have you been taking your meds?�. I get no help from anyone that actually means anything. I feel like I�m screaming into a void and no one is actually paying attention. I feel so incredibly alone. 

I�ve never really had suicidal tendencies because I am terrified of death, but the idea of taking off in my car and never coming back gets more appealing by the day. I�ve even daydreamed of going to sleep and just not waking up. Not dying, just not waking up. Never having to deal with any of this ever again. 

Before anyone asks, yes I�ve seen a therapist. I�ve been seeing one for about 5 years now but considering the current state of the world and my extreme discomfort around phone calls, I don�t really see it as much of a viable resource right now. I�m just lost, empty and don�t want to do this anymore. Everything is too much work. Getting better is too much work.",-2
199,sad,"To sum up, for as long as I can remember I've felt like an alien in my own skin. A grotesque monster like Frankenstein or a side show freak. I do not recognize myself if I look in the mirror and it is hard for me to feel attacted to my own limbs and other body parts. If I'm sitting in a group I feel like a shadow creeping in on normal humans. On my own I question if my body functions in a way that is human or if I'm some how completely wrong and poorly replicating it.

I have been diagnosed with depression, social anxiety and PTSD but never deeply divulged the extent of my feelings or lack of towards my body to any health worker. More and more recently I have felt that I am living without actually having an active role in my life. 

Idk why I'm posting this just that I need to get the thoughts out. I'm 21 almost 22 and feel as if I've not actually lived a life but just performing tasks that are expected of me. Worse is that my ""alien"" feelings are becoming confirmed in my mind as I get older. I've never had a relationship or even a mutual liking towards someone. I don't have close friendships or family members. At school I'm unnoticeable and unremarkable.This was unchanged by covid and while everyone around me finds it hard being alone its been my default. I've tried to change the social relationships around me and improve on my outside physical vessel but it never seems to work. 

I've concluded I've failed at being human. And although I've resisted suicidal thoughts as much as possible it's becoming easier imagining that if I'm dead it leaves space and resources to someone that is actually human. And my death is for the betterment of those around me to eliminate and reallocate the resources extended to my body. So at this point the only thing stopping me from ending it is not having the energy or willpower. So I guess rn I'm just gonna keep my body going like an old broken down vehicle that only runs some of the time and never quite right. 

I don't mean to sound overly whiney and like I'm seeking compliments or to be pacified. I'm just not in a position to talk to anyone regarding this. Thanks for reading if you have and well this was really my way of constructing my thoughts rationally. Or as rationally as my brain is allowing atm.",-2
200,sad,"I'm 30 m I've Been on meds for more than 4-5 , I've known that I have depression and social anxiety for about 8 years. Right now I'm at a point that I am on a relative stable state, but it feels like that's it I won't accomplish anything that I wanted when I was younger. 

I wanted to persue a career in the arts, not exactly fine arts but more into de videogame industry. I think that I had promise but one of the most important things that I failed at was at ""networking"" the thing is that at the time I didn't even knew that I messing everything up I just felt axious and just didn't want to be in social situations.

Well as I got older and I started to figure how the world works and also started to think a little bit more clearer I realized that I had lost my opportunity to do the thing that I wanted.

Now I feel that I'm just here waiting for something to happen ,I don't feel motivated to do anything else I don't see the point I don't feel motivated,, then I just feel that if I try again I'm just going to fail again. 

As I've grown older it has become harder to stay focus ,I've always had difficulty staying on task but I feel like now even more

201,sad,"Please someone else tell me they feel this way...

I was always happy throughout school but when college started I suddenly became obsessed with having a boyfriend. In my mind I would only be completely happy when I had a boyfriend. The problem is when these attempts of relationships fell through I�d become fully depressed. I remember I went on like 3 dates with a guy, started dreaming about him being my boyfriend and when he rejected me I cried for like 3 months. 

At uni I eventually got a boyfriend but he was nasty. The relationship was making me unhappy but I was so desperate to stay in a relationship I just stayed in it. I also became really anxious all the time. He eventually ended it and I legit wanted to kill myself even though I was miserable anyway.

I eventually got over it but now I�m sad about being single again. It�s so annoying but I don�t know how to stop the thoughts consuming me! It�s embarrassing to tell anyone. Does anyone else feel the same or have any ideas how I can stop?",-1

The only reason I haven�t is because my hamster relies on me and I don�t want to inconvenience anyone I work with (which I guess sounds stupid but whatever). 

The past few months I�ve felt my self-esteem hit absolute rock-bottom. I�ve always thought I was fat and ugly and had too many mental health issues to ever feel good about myself but recently I was also diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder that�s caused me to lose a lot of hair. Because of this, I feel worse than ever and find myself constantly comparing myself to my friends (which I know is just me projecting and a reflection of myself and NOT THEM).

204,sad,"I'm a 21F and I have a tough time trying to keep friends. I won't go into too much detail since that would take to long (unless you want to know). But, growing up I had very few genuine friends. In elementary school, I had a friend who was jealous of me, she would talk about me behind my back and even gaslighted my best friend about me and another one who would put me down constantly. Middle school, I had a falling out with a close friend every year because of bs or because they betrayed my trust or me as a person. The worst year was 7th grade. Before I moved, I was friends with a group of boys and I started dating one of them and one of the guys started bullying me relentlessly until I moved. Then that summer when I made friends at my new school, one of my friends let my other friend who I had a falling out with go off on me via text. 9th grade, two of my friends became closer with each other and ultimately pushed me out of the group (I believe it was unintentionally though because I don't have ill feelings about them) and another friend started ignoring me out of nowhere. The rest of high school was me having school friends except for maybe three. I'm still friends with them, but casually. 

I'm 21 now, and I'm scared to make new friends and get close to people because I'm afraid they're gonna either a) get sick of me eventually b) abandon me or 3) tell people personal things about me like my old friends. I know it's silly, but it's a legit fear I have. My childhood friends broke my heart and I don't want to go through that again. But I so desperately want a best friend again. And honestly, its even affected me trying to date. I do want a boyfriend, but intimacy freaks me out. My mom always talks about me not having any friends or not dating and it hurts me because I want friends, but I'm afraid to make friends.It's just frustrating because I'm 22 in two months and I don't want to keep holding on to my childhood issues but it's like I can't help it.",-1

We want (L) who smiles and jokes about how she witnessed her best friends die horrible deaths, they want to hear a joke about something they hope they never fucken experience, but because I have they want jokes and not real emotions towards the subject. I can cry while laughing and making jokes but as soon as (LN) comes over and the jokes stop and the true feelings come out they don't like me no more.

206,sad,"

I'm just at a complete loss of what to do.

I've never been known to be the kind of person to stand up for myself. If being complacent meant keeping another person happy, then I'd have no problem doing so.

However, I'm sitting in bed at 3 A.M. completely angry and frustrated because I've let people walk over me for too long.

My big issue at the moment is that I'm currently living with my grandma and she brought a guy into the house. My parents had moved out of the house and I stayed behind while my friend moved in. This was an arrangement I was happy with. Both my friend and I would pay rent to my mom each month and we would both live in the house. Then one day, my mom told me my grandma was moving in because she was breaking up with her current boyfriend and had nowhere else to stay. I wasn't too bothered by it at the time. She kept to herself and never really intruded around the house.

Not too long after she moved in, my friend was evicted for not paying rent which left my grandma and I. Because he was gone and my grandma kept to herself, the house started to feel like my own. I managed to pull myself out of a depression and began making the house my own. I would cook, spend time in the living room which I had personally furnished. I felt comfortable in what was essentially my own home.

Then around the same time, I feel like my grandma felt the same way. She began decorating. Placing photos on desks which I was using for my own stuff. Placing questionable figurines and art around the house (a notable one being that of a small indian man which scares me just about every night because it looks so realistic.) The decorating wouldn't have been such an issue had it not been so intrusive. I had made the living room to my personal liking (considering the fact I never used the living room even when my family lived here). She also began cooking questionable meals that were either barely cooked, made with completely crazy ingredients (such as a burrito with bologna, ketchup, and mashed potatoes), or were murdered with salt. Because she was always cooking, I lost my own desire to cook and just began getting takeout every day; something that she essentially makes fun of me for.

I could put almost all of this aside and live peacefully with her (and I did) until a few weeks ago when I came home to a car that I had never seen before. I assumed it might be one of my cousin's cars who frequently makes visits. It was also very late so I didn't think too much of it. I was in the living room the next morning and a man I had never seen before comes walking in with my grandma behind him. She introduces him and says that he's her new boyfriend. Again, I let it slide. She probably met him a little while back and best case scenario, she can move in with him or it'll be a small relationship and I'll never see him again.

Then one day, I came home and one of my dogs was tied up, one was in a cage essentially crying for me, and when I walked into the house, I discovered the entire living room carpet was gone and all the furniture was rearranged. I asked my grandma about it and she said that her boyfriend wanted to get rid of the carpet to replace it with new carpet and that she was afraid that the dogs would run away (which they won't considering they never have).

To wrap up my issues, I am actually extremely angry that this man I've never met before is essentially moving himself in and making changes to a house I just now started to become comfortable in. I wanted to talk to my mom about it tomorrow because she's the one who owns the house but I know the conversation will not go in my favor. She'll probably just tell me that it's best if I moved out which is an awful idea. I have such a connection to this house because as a kid, we were moving around so much. The longest house I had lived in prior to this one was no more than 4 years. Finally, now that I have a house that I feel is my own, it's being completely intruded on. And I wouldn't be able to afford my own place considering my job pays like crap (I could leave that job but that's a whole can of worms and another essay long as to why I haven't left). And I can't rightfully leave that job because it's owned locally and the boss relies on me so heavily that leaving would ruin our admittedly good relationship and possibly make his business harder to run.

In short, I feel like a house I've just learned to love is being intruded on and there's very little I can do about it besides make myself seem like a bad person in my grandma's eyes.

I have no idea what to do. I feel like I have no control over my own life. And if I do attempt to take control, I'm an asshole. I'm trapped.

Unfortunately, this is just the basis of my issues at the moment and it feels like it's boiling over badly. I've fallen back into my depression, have been drinking a lot, and am just generally angry and exhausted all the time. If I don't make some kind of change, I'm afraid I might just snap.",-2

209,sad,"I am an empathetic person. I care about social and political issues and the people being affected. I have been like this all my life. But recently especially(because of the current state of the world and the political climate) I have been exposed to a lot of information, news, events, things said/done by celebs etc about issues on literally every possible topic. I see the problems, the bad, and the things I find disgusting and horrible but get sucked in. Several people in my life have asked me why I care and get involved in things that don�t directly affect me. Well for example, im not black, but physically cannot ignore the injustices they face. I care and advocate for black people and the racism towards them disgusts me. And the events that have been happening recently I can�t seem to stay away and just �not care� like others in my life because �im not involved�. But in general, stuff like this takes a toll on me so much that I feel like it takes up a lot of my day and mind. The thing is I want to be informed and educated. However, I feel guilty, lazy, careless, and privileged to ignore all the things that are happening. I get angry and emotional and depressed and sad and anxious and basically all of the above. And I feel like every time i scroll on anything like twitter ig snap or see news articles and videos, I just continuously see the horrible things going on and can�t not look into it. I find out all the things happening and then it stays on my mind. My mom told me that I shouldn�t care so much and to just ignore it because I can�t do anything anyways and there�s no point. but I feel bad bc of reasons mentioned above and also i feel like being informed, sharing info, finding petitions, and donation pages to send money to do help people a lot and do make change. So my question is, how do I stay informed and educated without being sucked in and making it all have a negative effect on my mental health. How do I also calmly discuss topics that are sensitive and controversial without getting mad sad or emotional especially when there are actually certain people out there that have disgusting views and morals that when hearing from I want to throw them into a brick wall lol.

211,sad,"My daughter is a year and two months. I love her to death. She is my everything in this entire world. I could lose everything else, but as long as I have her, I'll be fine.

A little to explain...

I was homeless when I found out I was pregnant with her. I am an abuse victim from both my childhood and my adulthood. I have childhood Dissociative PTSD with trauma based hallucinations, GAD and Depression that worsened with my Ex. I had just been kicked out by my grandmother. My abusive father gave me up to her after years of mental, physical and S-xual abuse as a minor. When I was kicked out due to my grandmother not liking my friends and my severe mental breakdown. I couldn't work, go to school and I could barely leave the house due to my dissociation. She forced me to go back to work too soon with the threat of kicking me out, which caused me to lose my job. I started getting better but still wasn't working as often as they would like me too. So, they pushed all of my bills and $500 of rent on me to force me to start working more.

I decided to get away and go on a 4 day vacation with someone they never met. While I was gone my grandmother had to be hospitalized for high blood pressure and I couldn't get back into town. When I returned I was told I was never allowed back. The house, everything was locked, even the garage. She thought I was with my friends from school that she didn't like. So, I was kicked out. 

I ended up moving in with someone who turned out to resemble my father. Controlling, manipulative, abusive. Just a terrible human being. I couldn't work, leave the house. He worked offshore for two weeks at a time. I would be alone for two weeks having to ration out my food. The one time I left without his permission while he was there, he forced me back inside and forced himself on me while screaming in my face how terrible of a human being I was. My daughter was sadly conceived through a day of force.

I ended up leaving him and went homeless, only to find out I was pregnant three days in. I planned on aborting but was denied twice due to my poor mental health. My ex told me that he did not want this child to live, but didn't want anything bad to happen to me. Under any circumstances. He didn't want her to live. Therefore. He was gone. He doesn't know that she is alive. Her name. Where she is. His name isn't on her birth certificate. No one on his family knows she is alive.

I moved in with my mother who I hadn't lived with in years after two weeks of homelessness. I went to file a restraining order but since it was past a months time, they couldn't do anything.

I had an angry pregnancy where I didn't want to feel her move, see her photos, talk about her. When she was born, I had to learn to separate her from my abuse. Learning that it wasn't her fault. I worked hard on learning to bond and love her. 

Yet, now. I seem to depend on her. I feel like we have been through so much together. Even though she wasn't born and didn't have to experience it. I feel very protective over her. To the point I'm willing to end any and all relationships that may get cross. I feel bad, but I scold my boyfriend (Who I met at 5-6 months pregnant) if he gets too frustrated with her. I feel bad because I told him that if it comes down to her or him, it will be her everytime. If I have a bad PTSD night, She is in bed with me and just looking at her makes me feel like I can breathe.

My daughter gets very clingy with me as well, but I know that is just a toddler thing. I go through days where I just need to be able to see her. It makes it hard to work and do normal things. As I speak she is laying next to me in bed where I can watch her tiny sleeping face. I get nightmares and I need her. I have trouble sleeping and I need her. I'm having a bad day and I need her. I'm upset and I need her.

I just feel like there is something connected so deeply in my past trauma with the two of us. That we survived together. We made it out alive together. We want each other... Yet, at the same time, I know that it's just me. It's just my brain trying to attach itself to something so I feel less alone, scared and traumatised. That I attached myself to her so I feel like I'm not alone in my trauma. That I'm sharing it with someone and we are making it through together... But it was me. Not her. I did. And it makes me feel so alone. I try so hard not to cry in front of her. My father did that to me while he slit his wrists. I remember how terrible it felt. I do my hardest not too... But it just gets to be so hard sometimes. I don't know how to set healthy boundaries with her. She isn't my therapist. She isn't a coping doll. She's a human being and she shouldn't be forced to be my comfort item.

How do I move past this?",-2
212,sad,"(First paragraph is context) My Uncle David was not supposed to live past his 5th birthday and has proved that wrong by being a beautiful and amazing influence in my family's life for over 50 years. He was born to my grandmother, his birth father left before the end of the pregnancy and his entire side of the family wanted nothing to do with my grandmother and her downs child. He has obviously created a lot of issues and obstacles in her life but she eventually found a man that would accept David for who he is rather than what he has. I digress, David has like I said; created a lot of obstacles but was a loving big brother to his siblings including my mother; along with all of his nieces and nephews. This stands out to me more than most because I grew up with him being around and being the first grandchild I was given a lot more attention by the family than the predecessors. I live him almost as much as he loves me and that is why I feel obligated to help as much as possible even if I can't schedule doctor's appointments. 

Roughly 2 years ago, David moved out of my grandparent house and began living with my mother. Things were normal as they could be and everything seemed well. My grandfather has taken a job 2 hours away and they could not take David with them, my mother volunteered to take care of her big brother while they were away. 

My grandparents returned home after my grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer. She went through all the treatment and she is now a survivor and cancer free. They performed multiple surgeries and she was bandaged and bedded at home for some time. Everyone decided that David needed to stay at my mom's house longer until my grandmother fully recovered due to David being very sensitive when he is aware that his family members are ""hurt"" or ""sick."" He usually becomes overwhelmingly concerned and upset especially when his mother is sick; so it is safe to say that was a good call.

The issues began maybe 3 months ago. My mother ran into a mouse problem in her house while David was staying there. They mice were quickly exterminated and it was not an issue. I moved out of my mother's house as did my step-brother. Maybe a week before I left, David began having sleeping issues. He would stay awake all night even without any distractions. He would lay or sit in his bed throughout the night and then get up when everyone finally awoke for the morning. He would then be very drowsy and tired throughout the day and even falling asleep at dinner and outside. He would get maybe 2 hours of sleep throughout the day with 20 minute intervals of dozing off. 

This seems all quite standard, he just has sleeping issues. This is were things get disturbing, David began talking about seeing mice. He would describe them like a six year old would describe a nightmare about rats. He says they have bitten him, hit him, squeaked at him, and just generally distracted him from sleeping. This was assumed to be an excuse for him not sleeping as he often makes immature excused for a lot of his behavior. However after some time we all realized that his in genuinely seeing mice and he isn't lying about it. He would point in a dark corner and say ""there's a mouse"" after investigating and discovering there is no mouse he would accept is and laugh. 

We cleaned out his entire bedroom, moved furniture and moved him into a different room, to no avail. David would talk about seeing a mouse or some mice in various locations where he sleeps. He was scared of them and David is very hard to scare. He loves horror and is never scared by anything other than real danger. His voice shakes and he tries his best to explain his terror. 

Everyone decided it was time for him to come home, he needed to be back in his parents house and maybe he would be able to sleep and stop seeing mice. I have been staying with them and helping keep an eye on him. Everything seemed fine for maybe a week. He went to the doctor, they gave him some sleeping medicine and he slept well for maybe 5 nights. Now, he is back to being unable to sleep, he takes his pills and he still just sits and lays there. He whispers to me and says, ""there's a mouse under the bed."" I tell him there is no mouse, I look under the bed I confirm there is no mouse and he is alright, an hour later he is back at it. Yesterday, he came outside where I was swimming and brings me his shoe and says there is a mouse inside of it. I turn it over, sake it, put my hand inside, beat it on the wall, and say ""no mouse in here."" He accepted it and walked off with a smile. Maybe 10 minutes later, I see him investigating the shoe, looking down the sole, shaking ti, beating it out, doing everything I did except putting his hand inside. He was handling the shoe in a way you would expect someone to handle a shoe if there was a mouse inside, expecting it to fall out. 

Me and my family are at a dead confusion, my grandparents are little help as there are old and tend to have the ""shake it off"" mentality. With Covid, it is hard to get an appointment. I have thought of ideas including buying snake food mice and killing them in front of him to maybe shake this. We thought that bringing him home would take care of it. He is getting drained by this endevour and it is making him incredibly depressed. 

I need help, please.",-1
213,sad,"Remember when everyone was depressed and anxious during lockdown? I was the opposite. I worked out daily, ate mostly yoghurt, fruit and salads, walked my dog daily (5-10km). I missed my friends, sure, but we chatted daily on messenger or called each other when we were really lonely. Overall, I was a happy person. Now that things are almost back to normal, I feel terrible. I have less time for myself because I go to work now, I tried socializing, but all it has caused was stress. It got so bad that I uninstalled messenger and only talk to three people now (outside of the people that I just can't avoid, like family and coworkers). I stopped working out, instead of walking my dog we play fetch in the backyard. I eat like shit again, I already gained some weight. I feel anxious when I think about talking to my friends again. Is someone else experiencing this? I feel like I'm the only one, everyone seems happy that things are back to normal again...",
214,sad,"I've had depression and anxiety for years now. I find it difficult to touch another person. I can't even give family members a hug. (my relationship with my family is not the best though) And I find it difficult to trust people after a 5 year long abusive relationship with constant cheating and lies.

Things started to look up when I got into university and received an offer for a PhD position and I got my own place and I met someone who I thought was the love of my life. And now everything has started to fall apart.

In the space of a few months my health started to deteriorate, covid happened and I caught it and was even more sick for ages, my mum has been horrible to me, I feel like I'm letting my dad down because I physically cannot continue with a job he got me (due to health issues), my partner told me he never cared for me to begin with and made me feel like the worst person alive but I still love him more than I can describe (we are sort of seeing each other again but in an ""it's complicated"" way), I can't sleep for multiple days at a time, my relationship with my friends are deteriorating, it feels like the community I'm in and am most comfortable around no longer want me there, and I have no one to talk to anymore. 

I just feel so alone. I feel like I'm not good enough for anything and I can't seem to do anything right. I feel like no one can stand to be around me for longer than a couple of hours. I just want to lock myself away and never have to see another person again. I'm so self conscious I cant even go to the shop without a full face of makeup because I just feel so ugly and horrible.

218,sad,"

bit of a vent sesh as well, my apologies. there�s a lot going on in my head as i type this. 

a little context: i grew up in an abusive/neglectful home. father being the abuser, mother being the neglectful one. my father is now out of the picture (thank god) but i still live w my mom. i didn�t realize my home life wasn�t ideal until about 15. things my father should�ve gotten arrested for i thought everyone experienced until my friends at the time told me otherwise. my whole life i�ve made light of the situation, i�ve never really felt affected by my childhood, just thought it made me more independent, which is a valuable skill, so why be upset over something i�m not dealing with anymore and made me stronger?

because i was a kid. i didn�t need strength i needed safety. and i�ve only come to that realization recently. only over the past month or so has it set in what i�ve really experienced and how awful it was. and i draw connections from my problematic habits now (such as allowing myself to be used by men because i want to help them, or more generally putting people before myself to an extreme).

all the time i make jokes about daddy issues. it�s funny because i�m functional. i�ve been told i�m �doing surprisingly well� for someone who�s gone through what i have. and i�m inclined to agree. until i realize that, again, i�m not living as people are supposed to. it makes me furious my dad has this effect on my life. i don�t care about him, so why am i still hurting? but the same thing happens with my other forms of trauma as well.

i make jokes. i don�t even notice when it happens sometimes. watching people overdose, having someone try to kill you, rape, etc. are all trauma. all of these i�ve experienced. and i never think it�s a big deal til i�m pulling at my hair, sweating, sobbing, and punching my bed at 4 in the morning. that�s when i think i need therapy. til i stop about an hour or two later, go to bed, and forget about it. these episodes come about every couple days. sometimes they�re less severe (sudden tears and silent sobbing for a couple minutes, not feeling and wiping the tears away for a couple minutes, repeat for an hour). i don�t like that i don�t know my own emotions, and i don�t know how to handle them. my only coping mechanisms are unhealthy and self destructive, and that was with stuff that bothered me less than this. i�m a little scared i could do some real damage to myself if i let my emotions get the best of me and can�t find a healthy way to handle this on a daily basis.

219,sad,"I just want to preface this by saying I�m not gonna kill myself anytime soon. I just really really want to.

One of my problems is that I have a really hard time opening up to anyone about any of my problems, especially family. I just know that if I tell them any problem I�m having that�s what they�re gonna think of anytime they think of me. I just keep up an image of a guy who really doesn�t care about anything and is always looking on the bright side, even though that couldn�t be further from the truth. 

I�m 16, so I still live at home with my parents, which means I have to go through them to get any mental health services. Earlier this year, things finally got so bad that I asked my parents to see a therapist, by saying it was because of stress at school. I already could barely stand telling my parents this, but then it got so much worse. I made the mistake of telling my therapist I was cutting, and then he told my parents. And now they know I�m a cutter, and now I know they think of me as a cutter. After they found out, I could barely talk to them anymore and I because a lot more withdrawn. I couldn�t stand being around them, because I knew what they were thinking. 

It got bad enough that I told my therapist I might try to kill myself, and he sent me to a psych ward. It was absolute hell. Now my parents think of me as a psych patient. And now I know every time my parents see me they see a psych patient. Each time they visited me I could barely talk to them, it hurt like red hot fire. When I got discharged I guess they realized I really didn�t want to talk about this anymore so they didn�t bring it up. But I know they�re still thinking about it. I know every time I see them. I�ve managed to keep up the charade of being happy, playing it off as a miraculous recovery and I�m 100% fine now for sure. But I know they know that�s not the case. I know they�re still thinking of me like that. I know they know I�m lying.

But now my birthday is coming up, and our family has a tradition of talking about everything going on in the past year. I�m dreading this, because even if they don�t mention it, I know for sure they�re going to be thinking about what happened to me. And I know it�s gonna be absolute hell to me. And I can�t tell them that I can�t do it this year, because then they�re gonna need a reason. And I can�t give them a reason because that�s even worse. I just wish I never had to see them or anyone who knows anything about me ever again. I wish I could just die. But I can�t. I don�t know what to do. Every option hurts too much. I�ve stuck bandaid over bandaid on all my problems and they�re so dangerously close to bursting off. What do I do? 

I don�t know why I care about this stuff so much, but I do. Anyone I�m close to knowing any problem I�m having quite literally worse than death. I just hate it so much, and it�s preventing me from doing so much. What do I do?",-2
220,sad,"

I've been struggling with depression and anxiety my whole life, from what I have been told by a psychiatrist years ago I understand it's probably genetic (I have not looked further into it so apologies if its actually impossible, but there is a pattern running up my maternal line). There was a period of time in school (from ages ~12-18) where I was suicidal, but lazy. I wanted to die, I just didnt want to go through with the effort. I tried strangling myself, overdosing on my psych medication, I held a knife to my wrists, but I just couldn't do it. Maybe I was afraid of doing it myself, afraid it would hurt, or just afraid of it while simultaneously wanting it. I dont know.

I've been out of high school for a few years now and began college after a period of self exploration, and I guess you can say that I'm doing better. If I wasn't afraid of death before, I can safely tell you that I am now. I am truly afraid of death, and its keeping me awake at night. I cry and get anxious and sad because I know theres nothing I can do about it. I love my parents, but there will always be a small part of me that hates them because they created me knowing I would die some day, that it would hang over me until it inevitably happened, and that I would lose a lot of people I hold dear to the very thing I am afraid of along the way. I want to stop driving a car/going on the road (and a lot more things) because I know one accident could end it all. I dont stop doing these things, because I know my life would be more miserable without them.

I'm angry and frustrated that no matter what I do, how hard I work, I will die no matter what. I could live the best life or the worst, it's all going to end either way. One of my greater fears is getting some sort of brain degenerative disease (which also runs in the family, so it is a possibility), to lose my dignity and my memories and me. Part of me hopes for it, so that I wouldnt have to know that I would be in the process of dying. 

I have mostly stepped out of the wanting to die stage in my life (hopefully for good) and now I have crippling anxiety and anger following me around. Every once in a while I have a split second thought that I should just get it over with so that I dont have to deal with it anymore, but I never act on it nor do I want to. Even if I did, I would have a panic attack before I could even do anything. I have a lot of things I value in life to go so soon. I know I need to go back to therapy, I just needed to get this off my chest.",-2
221,sad,"I�m (M26) physically healthy, parents are alive and good, i also earn moderate.

But the moment i wake up I�m down with negative thoughts. Like my parents are dying or anyone i love. I�m in a relationship and instead of thinking or reminiscing about great time before COVID-19, all i get these thoughts that someday she�ll be married to someone else or she�s gonna die. 

Now, many of you can think that this behaviour of overthinking or thoughts only occurs with the people i love, but that�s not true. 
Just imagine I�ve heard about something about you and (though I don�t know you that well) very next moment I�ll think or a thought will come to my mind that s/he�s gonna die or something bad is gonna happen(which doesn�t happen).

At first, I thought all of thoughts were the result of watching thriller or action movies, since I watch a lot of movies. But I�ve started watching light hearted comedy/rom-coms, but same situation. Same thing i did for music, listening to calming music, nature�s sound etc etc.

I�ve tried medication, meditation. I�m even on a pill that i take 2 everyday(since Jan�20) to reduce hypertension. But seems not working at all. Everyone tells me to chill, but i just can�t, I can�t get those negative thoughts out of my head. I�m tired of thinking negative things all day long, i just want this to end.

I really don�t know what�s wrong with me, if there even is anything wrong. Because, you know, there is never anything �wrong� with �you�.

224,sad,"I experience emotions, and I know the difference between a pleasant and unpleasant emotion, but I can never name them. I can�t name them because, while we have all these names for different emotions, how am I supposed to know what each one feels like? I�ve never felt someone else�s �sad,� so how do I know if �sad� is really what I�m feeling? I guess emotions are that subjective. Is there a universal experience for each emotion?

Another thing is that my emotions seem too complex to put into a little box. Too abstract. 

It�s really fucking me up. I�m really struggling right now and when I go to professionals to reach out and say I�m struggling, they ask me what I�m experiencing. All I can say is that I feel �bad.� Obviously that�s super vague and not helpful, but I genuinely don�t know how I feel. I can�t get help because professionals are telling me I�m just being difficult, or they don�t take me seriously to begin with.

228,sad,"I feel like I have no right to complain or to be sad at all...

I made a mistake that changed everything, and I got hurt by others as well, which is fine.

But, when I start feeling depressed or nervous, I get told that pretty much I don't have any right to complain, and that I should ignore what everyone else says and just focus on myself.

Four months of isolation thanks to the pandemic didn't help either.

I realized that I made a mistake by taking 100% of the blame... I have at most 50% of it, as they were people who hurt me when I didn't do anything to deserve it.

Aside from a few people, I'm alone, and when I say alone, I mean the type of crippling loneliness that burns you with frostbite from the inside.

I awake to an empty What's App most of the time, I deactivated my Facebook account because I was tired of being left in seen again and again, and I don't really use social media to talk to others anymore aside of Reddit.

These days I've been feeling terrible, I ended up shivering from an anxiety attack at Friday, I get cold feet a lot, sometimes my stomach hurts or I overeat to calm down, it takes me in between 30-60 minutes to get asleep, I can't focus to study or do homework properly now that I'm back in class and so on...

And if life is focused on ""utility"", rather than honor or respect... Then I ended up being a tool for many people, and once I fulfilled my purpouse, they discarded me.

I will have to do months or years of therapy, just to become somewhat functional... Only to ignore what everyone else says or thinks, and just focus 100% on myself, while waiting for some miracle to happen.

Some people are strong enough to live on their own, to not need friends and just be happy with themselves, which is perfectly fine. But I'm not one of those people, nor I could become like that even if I tried...

In a nutshell, people can hurt me, betray me, manipulate me, use me and then discard me, treat me like garbage or just with pure indifference, and that's perfectly fine.

But, when I start feeling depressed or bad, because it's just too much, I'm the one who's wrong, I'm the one who should ignore everyone else, be positive, accept my circumstances and keep shut about it.

I'm mostly alone and isolated, my support structure is very, very small, they'll probably give us more and more homework and group projects at online classes (which make me very nervous to think about)... I feel like I want to snap.

There's no mercy, forgiveness or compassion for me... Just indifference, pain and loneliness...

I don't know what else to do... If I don't make therapy work it'll be useless, my stomach can't handle most pills and so on...

I guess I wasn't meant to be happy... Once I messed everything up, I have to accept that I'll surely have a broken, lonely and empty future...

I feel like I will eventually end up taking my life, because I keep losing and losing, and life keeps telling that I have no right to complain, and that there's no turning back from the past...

I don't know how much I will be able to last like this, I don't want to hurt my family or remaining friends, but the pain keeps growing day after day...",-3

But now I don't know, the motivation I had isn't there anymore with the exception of occasional bursts that disappear as fast as they arrive

I want to be able to sit down and talk through my feelings, even if just to myself. But doing that feels impossible because I immediately get overwhelmed with emotions. As if just thinking about who I am results in my mind defending itself by scaring me into distracting myself and when I confronted those feelings recently they made me scared to go to sleep.

I don't know what to do, as I haven't had anything like this before but I have had these emotions for a few months now and probably started 2 years ago and have slowly grown

What I want to do is become motivated again into aiming toward goals but I don't even have goals anymore, not ones that feel in reach anyway

Recently I have also been feeling as if I am constantly battling two sides of myself. One side is happy and feels like it's without a care, and the other one is one that just wants to ruin myself, whether it be telling other people about my emotions or contemplating self harm. When really that is something I could never do and flinch at the idea and hope that remains

231,sad,"I have been struggling with depression and anxiety since the age of eight. I remember how, from one day to another, with seemingly no explanation, I started being scared of sleeping at night, I was especially scared of silence. I borrowed a FM radio from my parents and would fall asleep listening to a French comedy channel so as to keep my mind from having dark/scary thoughts. Today, I am 27, and my anxiety and depression grew to where it paralyses me and makes me unable to achieve anything. Even the smallest task feels like climbing a mountain. I quit my job because I would start crying in the middle of my shifts or hide because my stomach would hurt from anxiety. I only feel good for a couple minutes a day and it's often mixed with a feeling of melancholy. I have a dream of having a musical career, I have been working towards this goal for 12 years and yet have nothing to show for it. I tried meditating, exercising, I took supplements, made sure to eat healthy, sleep on schedule... I am so tired of always feeling like I am dragging my body behind me wherever I want to go and making my family worry for me. I am terrified of continuing to live like this...

Inside of me, I still believe that there has to be a way to get out of this. Despite just how hopeless it can feel at times, I've not lost my optimism yet. But I also realized that I cannot do this alone. 

I finally made peace with the idea of seeking help but I cannot afford it. Do you know of any organizations/associations that are helping people who can not afford to get help by providing them with therapy & or other? To be honest, I am not quite sure to know what I am hoping for, but I am willing to try anything...

I know this sounds like a corona topic, but its actually not, just something that has been festering for a long time. I understand, from personal experience, that social interaction for humans is very important, but it's something I've always struggled with. I've never had many friends and never for very long. I have had intermittent social interactions here and there, mostly things where ""everyone was invited"" you know family birthdays, church activities (where everyone is over 60 anyway) etc, but I havent been out with my own actual friends since sometime in, I think 2009, no I didnt miss a 1. At 34, I've also never been on a 1 on 1 date, and not for lack of asking. My work is fine, I like the work and it keeps me busy. I go to the gym. I've pretty much given up on ever having any friends again much less a girlfriend even less get married but as a normal human thats trying to be honest with himself, I still really want those kinds of social/emotional/romantic relationship.

234,sad,"Finished my second year at uni. I struggled so much mentally and my grades suffered because of it. Computer Science at my uni is somewhat competitive so now I can�t major in it. It�s crushing. Devastating. I GUESS I could got to a different school and major in CS there but...

Even though I struggled at college I was still there for 2 years and I�ve become attached to the school in a way. Also it�s in a different city from my parents so that�s a massive bonus. No other school in my state catches my attention and out of state would be too expensive. 

So should I stay at my current uni knowing that I�ll have to major in something that I don�t like as much as CS for the feeling of safety? My heart says yes but I�m still not completely sure.

Thanks.

235,sad,"So for my whole life I feel like I have had problems with talking to people. Some time ago it wasnt as bad as its now. I dont exactly know where the root cause is, but I feel like its partly thanks to my parents who didnt force me to socialize when I was a child (it was of course my choice too tough) and now Im scared of talking to other people. So far my only friends were those from school, who are now leaving me in the dust (I havent told them anything about my mental state so far, Im basically wearing a mask in public, but I still dont feel confident). Its also important to say Im scared of talking to them too, so thats basically killing even those friendships. Recently I have tried out Discord, but even there im too scared to start a conversation or even say a single word. I feel anxious even when Im just simply sending text messages over there, or somewhere else (even right now). Overall Im definetly way too self conscious about myself, I usually think of things like: am I funny, am I annoying, do I look bad right now, do I have a bad expression and stupid things like that, it might sound fucking ridiculous to a normal person, but I get stressed over those things, think of the worst outcome and finally I doubt myself like Im some kind of weirdo that shouldnt be interacting with people. I think I might have grown a social phobia inside of me thats gonna make me even sadder and probably lead to depression (I might already suffer from it). So Im asking you people of reddit to please help me, give me advice on how to force my fucking being into a conversation with strangers without being scared, because thats the only solution I can think of.

I deeply thank to anyone responding.",-1

237,sad,"I want to tell you people about myself. I became virgin to non virgin at the age of 9. I was born schizophrenic. At the age of 9 after having virgin thing my school bus was burned. Someone saved from the fire as i was unconscious. When i became conscious someone grab me out of the school bus. My arm was burned. I went to several clinics or doctors to heal my burn. Then the whole year i was in pain. No cure for my burn was diagnosed. I was bullied in school. I was been separated from my friends in school. I was so quiet. In the age of 15, i was undergone a surgery that took one month. My grandmother diedin these years. When i was 17, my teacher sexually harassed me. I tried to tell my mother. She didn't listen to me. I tolerated him for a month because he used to touch my front top part. My brain ability to memorize was gone. I was spending my life like a dead person. Whenever i had exam, i cried everytime every subject every grade. Then i went to undergrad, my teachers make me so sick that i use to cry, they make my journey of University miserable. I cried and cried and cried. After doing my graduate, i burst with sadness i cried so much no one was able to stop me. I heard voices and vfb oices and cry. They gave me meds. Every 3 months i used to burst with tears and crying. All becausecof voices. I go for our holy mosque. I went to spiritual people. No one helped me but criticize me like everything that is happening to me is my fault. Then i came to US after one year i again burst with tears. This time i was not resting but walking n walking. My sis took me to a lady she made me cry. My own relatives made me cry. My own sis never see me with smile. My own mother made me cry. Hence there was no one in this world that hasn't made me cry. Who should i blame. I want to be people friends but not letting them know about my life journey. Its not easy for me it was never easier for me to choose happiness.

239,sad,"Hi there I�m 22 years old and live with my friend in a small apartment ever since my girlfriend died a year ago I experienced major mental illness and depression it�s gotten so bad that the only time I feel happy is when I shoot heroin or pop a pill I know it�s bad but I do it anyway to give me some happiness.I had a mental break down yesterday I was laughing out of nowhere just simply laughing my friend tried to snap me out of it but I just kept on then I started hallucinating about my girlfriend and I started screaming really loud,I was yelling so loud we got noise complaints.this went on for about 30 minutes until I snapped out of it and then I cried.I cried for the longest I�ve ever cried I finally let it all out after a whole year.Today I decided to quit drugs I threw all my pills out all the heroin and I decided to seek out help for once I feel sorta happy I would love some support because the idea of moving on is scary to me for some reason and I know I�ll still have moments where I�m sad and I�ll want to do drugs again so any support helps guys.",0
240,sad,"So pretty much what happened was a lot. It started in November 2019, I couldn't eat, and would throw up a lot, still don't know what was up with that, it went on until April 2020, it's just kinda been shrugged off as anxiety. It got really bad in January, I was down 12 pounds from already severely underweight and in and out of the hospital almost constantly. This caused me to have 59 attendence strikes 2nd semester, for a triple honors class kid going into concert season, it was really bad with low grades and missing work. But all of that was minute compared to February. 

On one of the last days in January my now ex asked me to meet him somewhere and I did, no big deal, we're dating, probably a pop date or something. Long story short I got raped. Or at least I think I did? He wanted to do sex and I did not. I told him no but he kept saying ""come on, don't you love me?"" ""Don't you trust me?"" And pushing me back against this one wall in the dugout we were in until I just kind of nodded. It wasn't vaginal penetration cause he simply couldn't find it, but it was anal and it hurt like a bitch. There was no pleasure and I wanted to stop after it first started but he said no, that we would be fine, that we were too far in to stop and that I should relax and enjoy it. I didn't even moan, there was simply no feeling. I just kinda let my mind go blank, like retreating into my head or go afk but in real life. I wish I had struggled more, but I didn't which is why I don't think it was rape, but on the other hand I was pressured into consent and when I tried to take it back I was denied. Either way it was statutory, he was a week past his 16th (age of consent in my state) and I was a week from my 15th, so still 14. 

A few hours after that a friend died of cancer, she was 16, her birthday was in April. A few hours after her one of my friends grandpa also passed away, all of my extended family lives pretty far away so he was like my grandpa as said friend was my ""cousin"" and most people assumed we were actually siblings. Three blows within 24 hours. As mentioned, my birthday was the next week, it was spent at both funerals. The following week was Valentine's day, supposed to be our 6 month. He broke up with me on February 12, and was dating one of my friends within the week. 

Right after I had gone through the shock of two deaths, the illness was getting way worse, I was at my lowest weight - 84. NOT healthy for a 5'4 15f. I genuinely felt I was going to die, if not throwing up, then chronic migraines and worrying fevers. Anyway, fast forward to February-July. Almost everytime I sleep I see one of the three events and wake up sweating and crying when it's really cold in my room and I sleep with no blankets. 

Whenever me and my boyfriend are talking and he makes a sexual innuendo as even a joke I get really bad flashbacks to that one night and other events like when he'd grope me on the bus when I'd tell him stop he'd just tell me to shush or cover my mouth. I know I was more of just a number to him, but it was nice to have some attention as my relationship prior to that was extremely physically abusive and I have lots of pictures of bruises from that one, and he also would sexually assault me, though I'd fight back and he'd threaten my little sister or smack me so I'd stop which is why I think I didn't fight the guy after him either. So yeah, the flashbacks can send me through whirls of sadness, anger, etc. And get triggered by sounds, scents, etc. Like they make it hard to breathe or move or anything and it's like I have to relive it every time and I just want it to stop. I just want everything to stop.

It feels a little better to kind of vent it all out though some of my friends say I should be over it by now. But I'm still not sure if it is PTSD or if it's normal or anything. Idk, answers or general support are much appreciated but definitely not required, I just need to be heard for once, I've felt for so long like my voice falls on deaf ears..",-2

243,sad,"Hey,

I�m a teenager, and I have a couple of problems.


So, first things first. Me and my mother don�t have a good relationship. We clash and she very, VERY obviously favours my younger sibling to me. She vents all of her stress into me and in return, this has started to take a toll on me. It�s not extreme abuse or anything, it�s just terrible wording and the constant complaining/nagging at me for minimalistic things, getting mad at me for making a glass of water but not my sister (even though she never asked for one), telling me I cannot be stressed and other things that I personally find quite harmful. I don�t even see her as a mother figure anymore, I feel much safer and much more comfortable around my grandmother. As far as I�m concerned? She�s my mother. 

Over the past year or so I think I�ve been getting worse. I very obviously have a stress issue (which my family denies by telling me I have nothing to be stressed about aka �get over it), the smallest things irritate me. I have breakdowns where I�ll sit and sob, particularly after my mother has gotten stressed/mad at me, but quickly get over them within 10 minutes or so. I struggle to sleep and I have what I can only describe as social anxiety (that might not be it but that�s the best way I can describe it). I�m extremely forgetful, I move backwards and forwards from my mothers place and my grandmothers and I keep leaving behind small things like chargers or wires (for my Xbox). This is another thing my mother gets stressed at me over and tells me that it�s my fault and I have to deal with it, despite my grandmother offering to bring it, she lives less than 5 minutes away. I also struggle to find motivation to get out of bed, do school work, ect. I also struggle to concentrate on multiple things and can only really focus on 2 things at once when I�m playing video games/listening to music (quite honestly the only escapes I have). 

I think I need help. A therapist or even a person at school to speak to. But as I�ve said before, I have what can only be described as social anxiety and I break down when trying to talk about any of this. I�ve also had a bad experience with therapists in the past (TW: slight self harm) related to me scratching my arms when I was frustrated which has lead to me not trusting them. I also can�t really talk about my actual feelings to my grandmother or mother, they�ve told me I can�t feel stress before and I�m afraid they�d either exaggerate it or simply push it aside. 

I�m struggling, and I�m only quite young. I don�t want this to get worse but I don�t want help. What do I do? And is there a name to what I�m currently experiencing (regarding my forgetfulness, stress and breakdowns)?


Thank you so so much for your help.",-2
244,sad,"I'm 19M and I've been full of anxiety for the longest time regarding the future. In two years, I'll be done with college and I'll have to join the ""real world"". I don't think that I'm emotionally ready to handle it. I don't feel like an adult. I don't know what I want to do with my life or how to go about getting it. I'm supposed to get a car and a house and a girlfriend and a bunch of other things, but I don't even know where to start. I wish that there was some sort of roadmap that I could follow. I'm terrified, that if I just rely on my own sense of intuition, I'll just screw things up. I hate thinking about all of this. It makes me sick to my stomach and puts me in a bad mood for the rest of the day. The worst part is how immature I feel about all of it.

245,sad,"I have a bad time in groups, especially in char groups. 

There is group of college classmates and we chat there about random stuff sometimes. 

we disagree often. 

However, I have noticed that whenever there is a disagreement I am far more scared about it than I should be. In this group when we disagree, I hardly ever want to know what the other person is saying, and I am shit scared that what i just said is not misinterpreted. 

I label my jokes as ""jokes"" so that they are not misinterpreted. (for which i get told that i should not do that because apparently labelling the jokes kills the jokke)

But there have been instances in the past where my jokes were misinterpreted. I just wanna avoid that. 

I have some rather liberal opinions and when i voice them apparently I am being too woke or copying my ideas from twitter or reddit. 

I get accused of being too condescending often. 

&#x200B;

anyway things got out of hand. this guy and me were saying things to each other and both of us were joking. So in the middle of that he assumed that i wasnt joking about something i said and reacted rather violently.

247,sad,"*DISCLAIMER*: I have no actual degree or any formal education in psychology, only a personal enjoyment for learning about it and mental health. I do not claim to have self diagnosed and I will be bringing it up with my medical professional.

I am 24, female, I've grown up having to deal with emotional neglect and abuse, divorced parents, one alcoholic parent and one workaholic. I've dealt with depression, both my own and my mums, I've looked after myself from teenage years and I've been looking for answers my whole life as to why I am the way that I am.

For the last (I wanna say) 8 or so years, whilst doing reading into the mental world, and talking with friends and others that have a diagnosis or experience in the area. I have long found a connection with the disorder of BPD (now called EUPD). All of the criteria seemed to make so much sense to me and I have since used that to explain my 'symptoms' to doctors.

So life happened blah blah blah, cut to a couple weeks ago when my ex-now-friend (who only recently received his own bpd diagnosis) informed me that he has also now been classified as autistic as well. Now firstly this is hilarious because all through our relationship he would joke that he thought I was the autistic one. He isn't the first person to think this either, a couple others have asked me if I have been checked for autism. 

Now, I have done minimum research on the subject in the past, I guess I didn't want to think about him and the others being right. However after my ex telling me this, I had that feeling in my mind and my gut that there was something here that struck a cord in me. 

The fucker was right after all. I've spent an hour going through different medical sites building a solid list of signs for autistic girls and i went into shutdown mode because it freaked me out at how fucking accurate it is!!!

I very likely have autism and it makes so much sense.

But I now think that no one will believe me because I've been so intent on finding an answer, I know people are gonna think that its just my new obsession for the week or whatever (thats an exaggeration, I'm not that bad)

But yeah, anyone else had a 180 with mental health or people with late diagnosis'???",0

249,sad,"I�m having a hard time working out what to do with my life. Today I spent most of the day feeling down thinking about how my degree in psychology is practically useless where I live because I chose it with the dream of going into research which is just not practical given I live in a very small country town with no research facilities. My partners sister rang her and was talking about how she was thinking about changing careers to a job I always thought might be a backup for me and she�s in no way qualified or experienced but still talking to them and may well do a short course and get a job and it made me realise that I�m putting all my energy into academia not only because I do genuinely enjoy learning but because I can do it from home and my anxiety is so bad I have been unable to hold down a job for over two years now. 

This is confounded by the fact that I�m in the process of being diagnosed with epilepsy and haven�t been allowed to drive and also that I�ve been recovering from anorexia (after ten years) but honestly it�s not these things that really hold me back it�s my anxiety and it�s so bad that I can�t be around people too long, I can�t sleep at someone else�s house and I can�t have anyone sleep at ours, I can�t catch up with people without my partner and when we do I am highly anxious and the activities have to be short, not involve food, and have a way for me to quickly get away. 

Antidepressants have never worked for me. I buy the self help books, see my psych, do meditations, buy anxiety apps, try to exercise more etc etc. 
I�m still afraid of life. I don�t know how to fix it. My life would be substantially better if I wasn�t so anxious and could socialise and connect with people, leave the house to pursue hobbies without a safe person (I love photography and videography), and work a job that would allow me to feel like a functioning contributing member of society (literally any job). 
My partner tries to reassure me that I do very well at uni but none of that means anything. At the rate I�m going I just see myself being someone with a lot of knowledge with no ability to apply it in any meaningful way. 

I�m so tired of living my life this way it makes me feel suicidal often. I�m just sitting on the outskirts watching opportunities pass me by and I�m getting older and no closer to being free.",-2
250,sad,"I'm 22, since I was 17 I've worked with 8 counsellors/therapists, I only enjoyed working with one of them. After 16 weeks (16 hours) I was discharged, the company told me I'd have to get a new diagnosis to reapply and then would have to wait months and after that there would be a tiny chance I'd be able to work with the same therapist again. This was around a year ago, I haven't received any treatment since.

I don't even know what to say anymore, since my girlfriend left (almost 2 years ago), I've had nothing to live for. I was very mentally ill when I was with her, I can't imagine what I put her through, but she gave me a reason to get better, I was doing it for us. I don't really know how to do things for me. 

I've been suicidal since I was around 12, I first tried when I was 16. My life has been full of betrayal, infidelity, deception. Mum cheated on dad and both my girlfriends cheated on me. Once dad was single he would ALWAYS have \~7 girlfriends, none of which knew about eachother. 

I've spent the last 4 years living in a big city but I couldn't take being alone anymore, so I'm back with my mum, temporarily. But if anything, I feel worse. Now I have people around, and still I feel completely trapped in my own mind. 

Everytime I think about the next step I think about how useless doctors have been in the past, I need to REALLY know what's wrong with me. At different times I've been diagnosed with: Depression, bipolar disorder, GAD, SAD, OCD, anorexia and CPTSD, all within the past 3 years. I don't even know what I'm trying to make better, there's just no way there's that much shit wrong with me. I have some fucking deep rooted issues and the task of finding someone that genuinely wants to make that better is too much for me now, I've been letdown too many times, I'm afraid the next time will be the end. 

I have no friends I see in real life, because I have no personality. My personality has become a collection of my various possible mental illnesses and the various things I've learned about how to treat them, I just have nothing to offer. No passion, no desire, I definitely would NOT want to be friends with me, I'm not a bad guy, I'm just fucking boring. The things I really love are video games, maths and psychology/helping other people, but they're fading really quickly.

Byron (Reckful) gave me really a lot of inspiration and hope, I could relate a lot to him. The way he was trapped in his own mind, his requirement for constant reassurance, his unquenchable desire to be around people he loves all the time. His path to recovery lit a real fire in me, it made me really determined to also get better, to be in a place where I was healthy enough to acquire those people I love and that love me back, to live a life where I have a purpose, to not perform the unthinkable act.

And now, after hearing the way Byron's friends spoke about him, how all they could really do is delay his death, how there was nothing they could do to stop it, how they all knew but knowing was worthless. I'm struggling to see another path for my life, I almost feel empowered, I feel no pain writing this because I want nothing more than to leave this plane of existence, to join Byron is his Everland.

I'm really fucking suffering from a huge amount of suicide ideation, I don't even feel sad, I just feel like it's already over. I'm not exaggerating when I say the only thing stopping me is my parents and my couple of friends, because I know these people really fucking love me and I don't want them to go through what Byron's friends are going through. 

I really need some sort of divine fucking intervention because I'mma fucking die. And even if my life is worthless I know my death will be fucking tragic for the people whose lives I am a part of. 

Please do not link me helpline numbers, they are all objectively dogshit help resources for me. I want to go to A&E again, but I'm not emotional enough for them to take me seriously, I'm dead inside. Last time I don't think they would've taken me seriously if I didn't have fresh cuts everywhere. I'm not really sure where to take myself anymore, my mum doesn't understand mental health and my dad is very far away, and has dealt with far too much of my shit for far too long. 

Stay strong, one day the world will deal with your mental illness better than you ever thought possible. I love you all.",-3
251,sad,"i often feel like i�m some insignificant person, and i know thats such a �boohoo my life sucks� kind of thing to say, but i genuinely feel sometimes i could disappear, be removed from everyone i know�s memories, and their life would not change. dare i say, it might honestly improve their quality of life. 

i know i have self esteem issues, i find it almost impossible to accept compliments a lot of the time. don�t get me wrong. hearing someone compliment me makes me so happy. �they thought positively of me. f* yeah.� but in my heart and head i sincerely can�t accept the compliment. i don�t believe what they say at all. �thank you�s are easy for me to accept. it means i did something that made the other person happy. i�m ok with that. 

even if my close friend tells me i�m a good person, i laugh it off. i say �nah�. one of my close friends told me she actually looked up to me and i was really surprised. not even like pleasantly, i was just �what? lol why?� kind of. even when my bf told me i was cute, some part of me said, �he�s just saying that because he�s with you. don�t even think that he means 1% of what he just said�. 

it even affects my work too, in hindsight, now that i think about it. i really want to ask for a raise, but why should my boss grant me that? it�s not like my work is amazing or anything. she doesn�t owe me shit. 

is there something severely wrong with me? does anybody else feel this way?",-1
252,sad,"So here�s a little backstory on me:
I�m a 16 year old guy. I�m pretty introverted (like 60-70% introverted), I�ve had pretty bad anxiety my entire life (socially and generally). I also have depression. I�m pretty sure I have ADHD and OCD as well. It�s hard for me to make friends, but even harder for me to keep the ones I make. I�ve never had a girlfriend. I�m interested in things that a lot of people aren�t exactly interested in (activism and filmmaking, for example). I come from a close family, but a lot of the time I feel like an outsider. I also feel self conscious about my body, my personality, and pretty much everything about myself a lot of the time.

So here�s my problem: I feel like I�m sinking, as you can read from the title. I feel like things will never be good for me. I feel like I�ll always have feelings of strongly disliking myself. I feel like I�ll never have long-lasting, strong friendships, or a girlfriend. I, a lot of the time, feel like nobody likes me and that people are only nice to me out of pity. I feel like nobody values what I have to say. There�s definitely more to all of this, but that�s everything that I have off the top of my head without making this post too lengthy. I, as you can obviously tell, need advice on how to feel better.

By the way, I do have a therapist for those who are wondering. I�ve been seeing him for about 3 years.",-1
253,sad,"Honestly, like many people on here, I�ve just been having a very hard time lately. I can�t shake the feeling that everything I hold close to my heart is being ripped away one by one. I was facing some anxiety and depression before coronavirus was even a thing, feeling pretty hopeless and all but my boyfriend was really supportive and reminded me I�m not broken and helped me find a therapist through our school. My life literally seemed perfect on paper like loving family, great school, good GPA, awesome relationship, financially stable, but I was still so sad and I couldn�t help it.

And then once corona hit and I had to move back home and my boyfriend and I became long distance it�s like everything external started to go downhill too. My pet of 10 years passed away, my dad lost his job, my boyfriend broke up with me, and now it seems like you name it, everything I start looking forward to gets screwed up somehow. 

My parents are really worried for me and make me send them pictures of me eating to prove that I ate since I�ve lost a ton of weight, and they witnessed one of my panic attacks just last week, but I�ve been having them for a while. My boyfriend and I ended well at first but I was really sad because I loved him so much and he wasn�t sad at all... and I just got so unexplainably mad at him for that. I feel like my depression ruined our relationship because I would have episodes and try to talk to him about all the ways my brain was sabotaging me and he just couldn�t understand and had to leave. And that�s a sucky sucky feeling because he was one of the only people who was really supporting me, and when I got angry I went off on him and I feel like I ruined that friendship as well and he�s just going to think I�m crazy.

Lately I�ve had weird thoughts around suicide. Mostly this: I feel like my entire problem for all my life has been this obsessive need to please other people. And for that reason I literally could not kill myself. I couldn�t stand bringing pain to my family like that, and I couldn�t stand people thinking I was selfish that I had everything so perfect and still couldn�t push through life, and I�ve grown up religious so obviously suicide has some bad stigma around it there. And even though it might seem like a good thing that I can�t kill myself, it almost makes me feel more helpless. Because if I knew I could just end things and life could have no more struggles then at least i have that control over my life, but instead it�s like I�m letting everyone else control it and physically cannot take my life into my own hands, not to mention that now it seems like that easy out isn�t possible and I�m going to HAVE to do life the hard way. Just feels very hopeless. 

I know that�s probably a bad thought to have and I�ve been trying to find a therapist around my home but since I�m working 40 hours a week and now my dad lost his job and we can�t afford anything expensive, it seems so impossible. 

Idk, it just sucks that I have these thoughts because I feel like depression will be so much baggage in whatever relationship I have from now on since it already made this very supportive guy that I loved so so much run away. And even though there shouldn�t be, there�s just such a stigma behind mental health problems and I�m afraid no one�s gonna wanna marry �depressed girl who has to post her suicidal thoughts on reddit because she doesn�t have anyone else who will understand�

254,sad,"Hi. I just need to vent as I can�t in to see my psychologist as it�s the middle of the night and I can�t talk to my family. 

So, tonight at around 9:30, I was on my way to dropping a friend home when we came across a car that had hopped a round a bout and two cars with hazard lights on. I being a trained first aid personnel pulled over to check if everything was okay. Lucky I did because no one else on scene was first aid trained. Unfortunately the driver who had jumped the curb had apparently not remembered doing this and their head was hurting quite bad. I remained calm and I communicated with the people on site, told her to not move or get out of her car as there was no sign of danger, and called the ambos. 

I relayed all the information to them while having someone keep her calm. We were close to the police stations anyway, a one minute drive, so a cop turned up in about three minutes after the call. The ambos then arrived with two more cop cars. We gave them all the information we knew and was told by the ambos and coppas that I did everything exactly to how it should be done, that my first aid training had paid off and I executed it perfectly. 

I dropped my friend off, and talked to her parents about what had happened and why we were late. I told her and her parents to watch herself for the next few days and to talk to someone if they need to. After dropping my friend off, the shock of everything started to hit me. I called my young adults pastor and just told him what had happened (as we had just left from a young adults event) and that we both were safe. 

Now that I am home, I can�t stop thinking about the accident. I know I did everything correctly, but I feel terrible still, like I�m guilty somehow. I�m all fidgety, anxious, been having spouts of panic, small crying episodes, dizzy, faint when standing, and my movements are all jerky. I keep seeing the flashing lights of blue and red cop cars and ambulances. 

I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and RAD (reactive attachment disorder) in the past two months and my depression and anxiety had mostly cleared up with the help of therapy. But now I don�t know what to do. From tomorrow I will be living out of home and I�m supposed to be helping the rest of my family move out of the house tomorrow. I can�t sleep. I take melatonin for my sleep anyway but even though I feel tired I can�t sleep. 

I have an appointment with my psych on Friday and would get in sooner if I could but she only works Thursday and Friday. I don�t know what to do.",-1
255,sad,"i'm underage, and almost my entire life everytime i've gone to the doctors, my mom has come with me as i'm too anxious to be alone. for a couple of years i asked my mom if i could get tested for adhd. and everytime i brought it up, i was shut down. i eventually gave up asking and haven't brought it up in at least two years. eventually my doctors put me on an anti anxiety medication, which didn't seem to work with my fidgeting, focus, my mind was still crowded, and i still had a hard time trying to word sentences properly as i couldn't find the right words to say. as of lately i've been wanting to get tested for adhd or try another anxiety medication. i dont know how to bring it up to my mom, and i feel as if my only options are to either say it infront of her to the doctor, or go into the room on my own, but i'm afraid she'll get upset with me for not talking about it to her before saying it. there are way too many negative outcomes for my liking and i really don't want to risk it.",-1

257,sad,"i woke up two days ago, and went to check my phone like i do every morning, but when i looked at my recent contacts, i saw somebody i swear i never talked to before. i looked at our previous messages and it was apparently an ex boyfriend where we broke the day before i lost my memory. i asked them who they were, we talked, and he got freaked out when i didn�t know who he was. he showed me photos of us together that i really don�t remember AT ALL and then told me to text another friend that i had no idea who he was referring to. i texted my friend and he was also shocked that i didnt remember anything about him. apparently we were really close. looking at photos triggered an emotion but not really any memories coming back. i�m not sure what happened like is it a physical thing? or is it a mental thing? and what should i do about it?",0
258,sad,"During the first wave of COVID, I took a break and deactivated all my social media accounts because I had a gut feeling I would be better without it. It made me feel really anxious all the time beneath the surface. For some reason, I feel really uncomfortable seeing what�s going on with others and seeing pictures of them.

I recently wanted to start pursuing twitch streaming with the support of my friends but I knew I would need to market and outreach through my social media�s so I redownloaded and reactivated. 

I scrolled through my Instagram feed for an hour or so and I feel so unstable. I feel like I am unhinged and I just have so much discomfort I want to scream. I feel like crying and shaking and never leaving my bed again. I don�t understand why it disturbs me this much. I don�t know if I�m using social media as a scape goat for my anxiousness or it�s the cause. 

Does anyone else also feel this way? Does anyone have insight?",-1
259,sad,When I was bulimic all I wanted was to be anorexic. Now I feel like I�ve fallen in love with restriction and I can�t stop. Why am I fucking like this.,-2
260,sad,"I'm not really sure how else to put it, but as of late every single day I get out of bed my judgement feels more clouded and I feel like I can't focus on what's important around me, like family and friends and it's gotten to the point I have no idea what to do. 

The reason I feel like I'm at such a loss is because I was totally miserable my entire senior year, and after a lot of talking it out and through some perseverance I finally left what was the darkest place I've ever been in, lost 25kg, got accepted into University, made a bit of money with my investments, but ever since I just feel like I can't get as good of a mental handle on things like I used to.
Not to sound conceited but I've always had naturally good reflexes and a knack for being quick on the uptake and I've noticed that I'm not just slower, but I'm straight up not reacting to things anymore, from simple things like catching an item that I'd dropped, to way more severe things like not reacting at all to the fact my car hydroplaned and I crashed off the road with my best friend in the car (Both OK luckily,[minor crash](http://imgur.com/a/NMOkH2N), write off sadly). And it f*cked me up, half a cars length away from killing either myself or my best mate and that's when this shitty cloudy, dissociative feeling started setting in worse each day.

And it's just starting to make me feel like something broke in me and there's a serious underlying issue. I'm not even sure how I'd approach a professional on this either, I just feel defeated and really dont want to get stuck in the spiral again but the more I feel like I've dissociated the worse I feel, it's like I'm losing touch with myself. It feels like I get through every day on muscle memory alone and that I haven't thought/been consciously aware of a single thing I've done all day.

I'm sorry if this isn't very cohesive or detailed, I've come up with nothing over the last few weeks of thinking about this and figured it might help to have someone else understand or even know what might be going on, because Headspace doesn't seem to know nor be able to help.",-2

I�m sorry, I don�t want to post a story that�s upsetting but I�m in need of support. 

A couple of days ago, I saw some horrifying things and I don�t know how to cope. I live in Texas. 

I live in a high rise apartment building. I woke up around 8:30am and got up to walk my dog. As I�m exiting the elevator in the lobby, I noticed about 4 cop cars roll up. I walked outside and I could tell something bad was going on. I could see a group of people gathered about 4 yards from me and I just couldn�t stop thinking �please don�t let this be what I think it is�. I quickly walked my dog and as I headed back inside, I saw a body with about 5 people around it trying to resuscitate it to no avail. 

About 2 minutes after I got back home, the police knocked on my door and had about 10 officers scour my apartment and question me after they told me they were looking for the balcony from which �an individual jumped�. After that, they knocked on my neighbor�s door and nobody answered. They had to break in with guns in their hands. Though I knew my neighbors were out of town, it was still very unnerving. 

I decided to go out an hour long walk to calm down. I cried, I tried to process. For context, I had a family member commit suicide when I was younger, so this topic hits really close to home. When I walked back, I figured the body might have been moved or at least covered. It was not. He was just there, uncovered, with no one around him. Dozens of cops were in the lobby. I was angry and confused and so much more. He was there for hours. 

I recognize what I�m going through is NOWHERE near what this man and his loved ones had and have been going through. What I saw, however, was horrible. I have GAD and this has drudged up some really shitty memories and feelings. I�m not depressed nor am I thinking about hurting myself or anybody, I just don�t know how to cope. What�s a healthy way to process something like this?

263,sad,"Recently I've been feeling very worried, and I felt like I'm running out of time.

I keep thinking that everyone I love will die soon, that i'll never see them again. I'm christian but It's hard to truly believe that I'll be able to see everyone again.

Perhaps I'm the one that will die, and I'm mourning for the ones I love.

Everyday if someone isn't with me or is not in the room I will start feeling sad and begin to mourn for them even though I know they're fine and they are not dead.

Maybe I'm really clingy and soft hearted, but it feels so real, like they're gone gone. That I will never see them again. I cry. 
I cry at night worrying about people I care about. 
I'm so scared, I feel like everyone will die soon, that something terrible is about to happen. 

Something like a tragedy, like I'll die or someone(s) will die very, very soon. 

I'm constantly worried, I'm scared, I'm really scared, I feel like everyone will vanish. I'm sorry.

266,sad,"I'm writing this on a new account because I don't want any answers to be influenced by my post history. Also, this is probably going to be a long one to explain my story a little, so if you take the time to read this post, thank you so much.

I've really struggled with my mental health primarily in the last two to three years.

# Background

*The Beginning:*

I had utilized my university counseling resources before but there was a limited number of sessions you could go to (which meant I wasn't able to go as consistently as I needed), and the therapist that helped me the most, was no longer there. I had tried other people through the university but they weren't able to help me, which made me feel more helpless, so I stopped trying to find another counselor. (I probably haven't been to therapy in at least 1 year).

*More recently (ish):*

At the beginning of this year, I got health insurance for the first time in a few years, under my parent. I also experienced one of the worst mental health lows for me, so I decided to take advantage of the health insurance, and finally get a professional opinion on what my diagnosis could be, so I could get better. My previous university counselor/ therapist thought it was Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I had suspected I suffered depression also (ran on paternal side of family). I found a psychologist that was in my insurance network and decided to make an appointment. (I thought psychologists could diagnose AND prescribe medicine, which I was looking for since I was at my end and just wanted to try every solution, not discounting medicine as I had in the past). Over 2 or 3 sessions, I received my report and was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and severe ADHD. My report was mainly about ADHD, as that was his specialty but I couldn't care less. I wanted help with my depression and anxiety more than anything. I went to a primary care doctor to hopefully receive medicine, since a psychiatrist was going to take longer. I was prescribed with generic zoloft and oh WOW! this was amazing for me. I hadn't felt close to my 'normal' self like this in YEARS. With my mental health issues in these last years, I've been known to be an EXTREMELY sensitive and emotional person... Even the mention of a topic of any of my stressors would be cause for an immediate breakdown (for ex. ""how's school going?"" my response: immediate waterworks). Or anytime I watched something, like something slightly happy happening to a stranger, or someone slightly talking about a past issue they had, I would just start crying. I'm an extremely empathetic person too which sucks cause I feel everything to my core. Anyway, this medicine helped me not be so highly reactive which I enjoyed!

*Present Day (resource journey):*

I am highly in support of therapy and medication, at least for me. Unfortunately even with the medication in the recent months, I am still struggling. My insurance apparently had not been policy yet so my psychologist and doctor visits had billed me personally and I pretty much owe about $4000. With the pandemic going on and other circumstances, I've basically had zero income coming in this year, so this has been an extreme stressor for me also. So with this being said, i don't have access to any professional help because i cannot financially afford any more, since I'm still in the $4000 medical debt (plus other debt but that's beside the point). I have 4 pills left of my medicine and I cannot ask for another refill, as my physician wanted to see me for an appointment again before she refilled. (Again, cannot do this as I cannot afford a doctors visit). I have about 2-3 weeks of a generic prozac that i first started with but ended up not using, as we switched me to the generic zoloft. i'll probably take these until they finish because I feel like something is better than nothing.

*Present Day (emotions, coping, etc.):*

I think I mentioned it prior but my coping mechanism is avoidance. So for MONTHS now, I haven't spoken to *any* of my friends. The messages come in but I ignore them because I don't want to put any of this on this. I think a lot of the answers to this question is to reach out to my friends and I know I need to because they're really starting to worry about me but I don't want to be like ""hey sorry i've been ignoring you for 28392243 days but I've been depressed and here are all my issues."" It's overwhelming for me to handle all of this so I cannot even imagine giving them this information to handle, especially with all of the awful events that have happened this year. Basically there has been a lot of sadness and struggle for everyone this year and adding my issues to their list is not something I want to do. I have a long distance bf who I talk to quite a bit but not about these issues largely, as he's not someone who handles serious issues or whatever well. Also no one in my family knows about any of my issues because my family and I don't talk about things. So basically I don't really talk to anyone lol :/

&#x200B;

# Conclusion (kinda):

Anyway, I'm sorry if this is so long. I tend to over explain myself but also feel like I left a lot of holes in this story, and I tried to organize it so that it was easier to follow but I probably made it more difficult but hopefully someone is able to follow along slightly.

I need help. I do want to say that I have not ever experienced suicidal tendencies, which I am thankful for, so that's nothing I have to worry about right now. But I've been failing at every aspect in my life for so long now and it's extremely overwhelming for me to handle. Therapy and medication have been the BEST solutions for me in this journey but I don't have the financial means to seek these resources right now. What can I do?

This shit has been going on since when i was 8 or something, sometimes it never happens but it started again in these days. Its really annoying and when i was small sometimes i would cry about it but now that im older i can bear with it (im 15 now) but still, i want to have a good sleep.",-2
269,sad,For a couple months or so I�ve been feeling weird. I feel incredibly sad sometimes and I feel like my body is in so much pain. I feel scared and lonely. I feel like I�m doing this alone. I have loving friends and family but I feel like I can�t talk to anyone. It�s 3am and I just finished crying in the bathroom. I have small thoughts of suicide but it�s something I�ll never do even if I really want to. But if there�d be a way to erase myself from existence without hurting anybody I would. Sometimes I start breathing really fast and my face and limbs go numb and I get dizzy. But I don�t get why I feel sad sometimes. It�s just sometimes I feel so happy. Especially when I�m listening to music or being with my family. Today we all watched the fireworks from our window and it was pretty cool. I�m an extrovert and I love being with people. I just don�t know if what I�m feeling is just in my head. Because there are points where I feel like giving up but then sometimes I feel okay and happy. Am I being dramatic or is there something wrong.,-2
270,sad,"Hi, since college days I've been struggling on my habit of binge internet everyday and it get worse on weekends. During workdays days I managed to get around 6-7 hours of sleep but on weekday sometimes I only got 5 hrs of sleep, sometimes if I'm lucky I get around 8 hours of sleep, btw I live in noisy neighborhood almost everyday construction noise are always persistent, loud edm music, hill song etc, noise mostly starts at 7am. Catching up sleep on weekends is a struggle as well.

I tend to have a habit of binging on Netflix, memes, socmed and games even on workdays, but it gets worse when its nearing end of the workday. I dunno I tend to act like a teenager when it comes to my sleeping habit, I have not so consistent sleep schedule on weekdays I tried to get at least some 6-7 hours of sleep, I tried to sleep before 1am but anxiety always get me awake at night, thinking about work, awkward conversation, past mistakes, existential dread, self loathe. Then on weekends I struggle to follow that not so ideal sleep schedule but I end my binging on same hobbies around 2 or 3 am worst 4 am, hence fucking up my bad sleep schedule more. I tried to use apps to manage my sleep schedule/anxiety but every time I finished a course example 1 month better sleep course I tend to spiral out of control again, I tried to journal everyday but I stopped, maybe because I was in stressful week at work, to forget the struggles at work I binge on same hobbies, it's been a week now since my last journal entry. 

My sleeping pattern/habits is now affecting everything from work, to family, even friends, takes noticing I've become irrational, irritable, out of focus, snub etc, worse are poor decisions at work partly brought by the lack of sleep. Also my dark humor has intensified maybe a coping mechanism to my failures. Also I struggle to learn my attention span is now of a goldfish. What's worse is that I have to learn new things almost everyday at work, working at it where learning new things, trainings are a must to keep up with technology, I hardly learn something.

I cringe on the quality of work I did, I felt like I'm the bad apple in the office, the weakest link, the slowest to learn or the one who couldn't follow instructions or do decent report/presenting. On health I'm now hypertensive, easily forgetting (I sometimes joke to friends that dementia has set in)

I felt dumber everyday as days passed by having this shitty sleep habit. I even struggle getting to post this on this subreddit, I dunno I feel so anxious getting help.

272,sad,"Quick introduction, this is my first time on this sub. I just wanted to talk about this because its something I noticed about myself. 

With whats been going on on social media and around the world such as Covid, politics, BLM and the new wave of sexual misconduct allegations, Im starting to feel disengaged? Emotionally numb? Detached? Idk what to call it but I think its affecting my real life. 

I noticed this yesterday when my sister came over and she talked about her history of being sexually assaulted. It didnt really get to me like I think it should have. My mom was in tears even though she already knew these things and I was just kinda there listening and asking questions. I felt like I should have had a stronger emotional reaction than I got. 

Ive told my friends on Discord ""Im in full Doomer mode"" kind of as a funny way of describing this cloud of hopelessness that has been following me around the last couple of months. Im hoping it'll pass but its something I started to feel concerned about after yesterday.

275,sad,"My lovely panic attack started today just before we got to my partner's parents house, where we were meant to be having brunch with them, his three brothers and wives/children. While I get along with his family, I am very wary of his two younger (twin)brothers, who are self-satisfied, rude, and obnoxious. They tend to expect things to go their way basically all the time. I'm not the only one to think this either. 
Anyway, in the start it was a mild attack, but then as his brother greeted us by tapping his watch (we were cooking bacon and eggs for everyone) I lost my head and had a go at him. Needless to say, I was judging myself heavily for that and it made me more anxious. 
While I was cooking, I became incredibly anxious, and could barely talk to anyone, or look at anyone because I was on the verge of years the whole time. Which was great, just as one of the younger brothers and wife announced they were having another baby. I knew this was coming, because they never organise family get togethers unless they have some other reason. But while it's a very joyous moment, I couldn't muster the false happiness that I should be feeling for them (middle of a panic attack, I'm also sick of everything they say and do being about babies, and also, my partner and I are putting off children for a little while, which makes me sad). I couldn't deal with this news and while I managed to hold it together, I also felt like a fraud with a very fake congratulations. 
I had to keep it together for another almost two hours before I could go home and fall apart. I just want to keep crying and my mind is going in circles and I can't deal with my thoughts and I don't want to keep judging myself, but wanted to vent it. 
It's so hard sometimes not to believe you're a bad person for something so small. I feel like everyone noticed my behaviour and I feel so ashamed. I'm usually much more mindful, even when I'm a little anxious, but it was just so out of my control today. I know it's temporary, but bloody hell, my brain is its own entity sometimes, and it's scary.",-1
